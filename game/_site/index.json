    "title": "2D Inverse Kinematics (IK) | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "2D Inverse Kinematics (IK) Overview The 2D Inverse Kinematics (IK) feature set allows you to apply 2D IK to the bones and Transforms of your characters’ animation skeletons. 2D IK automatically calculates for the positions and rotations of a chain of bones moving towards a target position. This makes it easier to pose and animate character limbs for animation, or to manipulate a skeleton in real-time. Applying 2D IK to character skeletons The following workflow continues from the 2D Animation package animation workflow, and demonstrates how to apply 2D IK to your character skeletons. Refer to the hierarchy of bones created with the 2D Animation package's Bone tools of the Skinning Editor. Add the IK Manager 2D component to the GameObject at the top of the hierarchy. This is usually the main root bone of the entire character skeleton. Add to the IK Solvers list by selecting which type of IK Solver to use. The IK Solvers are also added as additional GameObjects in the hierarchy. With an IK Solver selected, create and set the Effector and Target for the IK Solver. Position bones by moving the Target's position to move the chain of bones with IK applied. Example demonstrating how to use the IK Manager 2D The IK Manager 2D component controls the IK Solvers in the hierarchy. Add the Manager component to the highest bone in the hierarchy, commonly referred to as the Root bone. In this example, add the component to Plunkah as it is the Root bone in the hierarchy: To add an IK Solver, select the + symbol at the bottom right of the IK Solvers list (see below). Select an IK Solver from the three options in the dropdown menu - Chain (CCD), Chain (FABRIK), and Limb. Each type of IK Solver uses a different algorithm to solve for the position of Effectors. IK Solvers are iterated in descending order, with Solvers lower in the list referring to the positions set by the Solvers higher in the list. The order of Solvers usually reflects the order of bones/Transforms in the skeleton hierarchy. For example, if the arm bone is the child of the torso bone, then the torso's IK Solver should be set above the arm’s Solver in the list. Rearrange the Solvers by dragging the leftmost edge of a row up or down. Weight Weight measures the degree that a Solver’s solution affects the positions of the bones/Transforms in the chain. The IK Manager 2D has a master Weight property that affects all Solvers it controls. It is applied in addition to the Solver’s individual Weight settings. Restore Default Pose Select this to reset all bones and Transforms back to their original positions. IK Solvers The IK Solver calculates the position and rotation the Effector and its connected bones should take to achieve their Target position. Each type of IK Solver has its own algorithm that makes them better suited to different kinds of conditions. The following properties are available to all Solvers: Property Description Effector Define the bone or Transform the IK Solver solves for. Target The Transform which is used to indicate the desired position for the Effector. Constrain Rotation This constrains the rotation of the Effector to the rotation of the Target. Restore Default Pose Enable to restore the bones to their original positions before 2D IK is applied. Disable to apply 2D IK in relation to the Effector’s current position and rotation. Weight Use the slider to adjust the degree the IK Solver’s solution affects the original Transform positions. At the lowest value of 0, the IK solution is ignored. At the maximum value of 1 the IK solution is fully applied. This value is further influenced by the IK Manager's master Weight setting. The following properties are only available to Chain (CCD) and Chain (FABRIK) - Chain Length The number of bones/Transforms (starting from the Effector) in the chain that the IK solution is applied to. Iterations The number of times the algorithm runs. Tolerance The threshold where the Target is considered to have reached its destination position, and when the IK Solver stops iterating. Limb This is a standard two bone Solver that is ideal for posing joints such as arms and legs. This Solver’s chain length is fixed to three bones - starting from the Effector bone/Transform and including up to two additional bones in its chain. Chain (CCD) - Cyclic Coordinate Descent This IK Solver uses the Cyclic Coordinate Descent algorithm, which gradually becomes more accurate the more times the algorithm is run. The Solver stops running once the set tolerance or number of iterations is reached. The following property is only available to the Chain (CCD) IK Solver: Property Description Velocity The speed the IK algorithm is applied to the Effector until it reaches its destination. Chain (FABRIK) - Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics This IK Solver uses the Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics (FABRIK) algorithm. It is similar to Chain (CCD) as its solution becomes more accurate the more times its algorithm is run. This Solver stops running once the set Tolerance or number of Iterations is reached. The Chain (FABRIK) IK Solver generally takes less iterations to reach the Target's destination compared to Chain (CCD), but is slower per iteration if rotation limits are applied to the chain. This Solver is able to adapt quickly to if the bones are manipulated in real-time to different positions. ##Creating an Effector and its Target After creating an IK Solver, the next step is to set the Effector and its Target. A Target is a Transform that represents the target position the Effector attempts to reach. As the Effector moves towards the Target position, the IK Solver calculates for the position and rotation of the Effector and the chain of bones it is connected to. Follow the steps below to set a Target: Select the last bone in the chain. Create an empty Transform (right-click > Create Empty). It is automatically created as a child of the highlighted bone. Move the position of the Transform to the tip of the last bone in the chain. Select the IK Solver. With its Inspector window open, drag the Transform from the hierarchy onto the Effector field. Click the Create Target button. A Target is created at the Transform's position. If the Create Target button appears inactive, ensure that the Chain Length value is set to one or greater. The Target is created as a child of the IK Solver. It appears as a circle gizmo in the Scene view. Move the Target to manipulate the connected chain of bones. The Scene view Gizmo Toggle or customize the display settings of the IK Gizmos to adjust their visibility when animating your characters. This is useful when you need to improve their readability or to reduce on-screen noise when editing animating your characters. Global IK Gizmos Toggle You can toggle the IK Gizmos by going to the Gizmos drop-down menu at the upper right of the Scene view window, then select or clear IKManager2D (menu: Gizmos > Scripts > IKManager2D) to enable or disable the Gizmos respectively. Solver Gizmos Customize Solver Gizmos via the IK Manager 2D component that manages the Solvers. From the IK Manager 2D Component Inspector, you can individually hide the Solver's Gizmo to isolate only the Solvers that you are interested in. To further distinguish the Gizmos, you can also customize the colors of the Gizmos from the IK Manager 2D Component Inspector Scripting API Reference Adding New Solvers You can add your own solver by extending from the class Solver2D. Your extended class will then show up as a new solver under the solver menu in the IKManager2D component. Solver2D This is the base class for all IK Solvers in this package. IKManager2D will detect all classes extending this and accept it as a Solver it can control. Implement or override the following methods to create your own IK Solver: protected abstract int GetChainCount() This function returns the number of IK chains the solver owns. Use this to return the number of IK chains your solver owns. public abstract IKChain2D GetChain(int index) This function returns the IKChain2D at the given index. Use this to return the IKChain2D your solver owns at the given index. protected virtual bool DoValidate() This function does validation for all parameters passed into the solver. Use this to check if your solver is set up correctly with all inputs. protected virtual void DoInitialize() This function initializes the solver and builds the IK chains owned by the solver. This is called whenever the solver is invalid after changing the target of the solver or other parameters of the solver. Use this to initialize all the data from the parameters given to the solver, such as the IK chains owned by the solver. protected virtual void DoPrepare() This function prepares and converts the information of the Transforms (position, rotation, IK parameters etc) to structures which can be used by the IK algorithms. Use this to do any work to gather data used by your solver when updating the IK positions. protected abstract void DoUpdateIK(List effectorPositions) This function calculates and sets the desired IK positions for the Transforms controlled by the solver given a list of effector positions for each chain owned by the solver. The effector positions may be overridden by user positions if manipulated from the SceneView. protected virtual Transform GetPlaneRootTransform() This function returns the transform whose localspace XY plane is used to perform IK calculations. Use this to define the Transform used. IKChain2D This is the class which stores the transforms involved in an IK chain. When a chain is set up with a target and a transform count, initializing the Solver will populate the chain with the right transforms if valid. Target - The transform which is used as the desired position for the target. Effector - The transform to perform IK on to reach a desired position. TransformCount - The number of transforms involved in the IK solution starting from the target. This is generally equivalent to ChainLength in solvers. Transforms - All transforms involved in the chain. In general, the last transform in this is the target transform and the first transform is considered the root transform for the chain. Lengths - The lengths between each transform in the chain. Solver2DMenu This attribute allows you to tag your Solver2D with a different name under the IKManager2D. Use this if you do not want to use the name of the class of the Solver2D. Example when giving the LimbSolver2D the name 'Limb' in the menu: [Solver2DMenuAttribute(\"Limb\")]"

By repositioning the different bones of the actor on the Animation timeline with Unity's animation workflow and tools. The mesh of the actor deforms with the positioning of the rigged bones, creating smooth animation transitions. Aside from this method, there are other ways that you can animate with the 2D Animation package. The following are a few examples based on the Sample scenes available for you to import to use with the package. Sprite Swap The 2D Animation package allows you to use the Sprite Swap feature to swap to different Sprites at runtime, from swapping only a single part of an actor to swapping the entire Sprite Library Asset it refers to. Other Sample projects Sample projects are distributed with the 2D Animation package and available for import. These projects include examples of the different ways you can animate with the package features such as an Animated Swap. Refer to the respective Sample documentation pages for more information."

    "keywords": "2D Animation Asset Upgrader The 2D Animation package and its assets are often updated with major and minor tweaks over time. Some asset improvements can be automatically applied when you upgrade to the latest version of the package. However, some of these changes require a manual step in order to have the assets use the latest code path. The 2D Animation Asset Upgrader tool eases the transition and upgrade of older assets to newer ones. This tool has the following features: Upgrades Sprite Library Asset files ending in .asset to Sprite Library Source Asset files ending in .spriteLib. Moves Sprite Library Assets baked into .psb files created in Unity 2019 and Unity 2020 out into their own separate Sprite Library Source Asset files ending in .spriteLib.

Once the upgrading process is complete, the 2D Animation Asset Upgrader will display the status the upgrading process for each of the selected Animation Clips. Select the Open upgrade log button to get more detailed information about the upgrade warnings and errors that may appear. The upgrade log will also list all the Asset Bundles that need to be rebuilt for the upgrading process. Common upgrading errors and solutions The following are the common errors you may face when upgrading your projects, and their suggested solutions. Referring to the upgrade log for general debugging The first step to debugging an upgrade failure is to refer to the upgrade log. The 2D Animation Asset Upgrader writes each action it takes into the log, helping you to track down the point of failure. 9/11/2021 2:06:23 PM Asset Upgrading --------------- Verifying if the asset Talk (UnityEngine.AnimationClip) is an AnimationClip. Extracting SpriteHash bindings from clip. Found 0 bindings. Extracting SpriteKey bindings from clip. Found 0 bindings. Extracting Category bindings from clip. Found 0 bindings. Extracting Label keyframes from clip. Found 3 keyframes. Extracting Label bindings from clip. Found 1 bindings. Merging different types keyframes from the same bindings, into the same binding list. We now have 1 binding lists. Order the keyframe data in binding=Hand by time. Converting keyframes into uniformed format for binding=Hand Cannot find a category for keyframe at time=0 in binding=Hand. Cannot find a category for keyframe at time=3.383333 in binding=Hand. Cannot find a category for keyframe at time=4.966667 in binding=Hand. Expected 3 keyframes after cleanup for binding=Hand, but ended up with 0. The upgrade of the clip Talk failed. Some keyframes could not be converted in the animation clip. In this example, the upgrade log shows the actions and results from upgrading an Animation Clip that contains only Label hashes, but no Category hashes. The 2D Animation Upgrader writes to the log that it cannot find a Category hash for three out of three keyframes. This results in a failure to upgrade the Animation Clip. When some keyframes could not be converted in the Animation Clip One of the most common reasons for this error is when an Animation Clip contains either Sprite Resolver Category hash keys or Sprite Resolver Label hash keys, but not both types of hash keys at the same time. This example shows an incorrect Animation Clip setup where the Animation Clip contains only the Label hash, but not a Category hash, which leads to the above error. This example shows the corrected setup, where the Animation Clip contains both the Label hash and the Category hash. Fix this error by recording a Sprite Swap on the first frame in the Animation Clip. Once the Sprite Swap is added, the 2D Animation Asset Upgrader is able to upgrade the Animation Clip."

    "title": "Swapping individual Sprites | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Swapping individual Sprites You can use Sprite Swap to change only one Sprite on the actor without affecting the other Sprites. This allows you to alter part of an actor's visuals (for example, changing its clothes or skin to a different color) while keeping the rest of the visuals the same. In the following example, there are two Sprites that are variations of the actor’s scarf, with one being green and the other being blue. This workflow demonstrates how to switch from one to the other in the same actor: Left: The original green scarf Sprite. Right: An alternate blue scarf Sprite. Place the Sprites for both scarves into the same Sprite Library Asset, and add them both to the same Category (named Scarf). Give each of the Sprites a unique Label name (in this case green scarf and blue scarf respectively). This and the previous step can be automated by dragging and dropping sprites into the Categories tab empty space. In the Scene, select the Instantiated Prefab and then select the Scarf GameObject in the Hierarchy window. Go to the Sprite Resolver component of the Scarf GameObject. The Sprite Resolver‘s visual selector displays the two Sprites available in the Scarf Category. Select the blue scarf to switch the Sprite rendered by the Scarf GameObject to it instead. The Sprite Resolver's Label is set to blue scarf. If you want to switch more than one Sprite at a time, consider swapping the Sprite Library Asset to switch to an entire alternate set of Sprites. Sprites pivot alignment When working with skinned Sprites, the positions of their Meshes' vertices are calculated based on the current skeleton pose, and are unaffected by each Sprite’s individual pivot. However, when swapping Sprites which are not skinned (that is not Rigged to an actor’s skeleton), then they may not align correctly as their pivots are not in the same relative positions. This is especially noticeable if the Sprites are of very different sizes. The following example shows how Sprites can misalign when a skinned Sprite is swapped with an unskinned one: Figure 1: The original open hand Sprite. Figure 2: Swapping to the thumbs up Sprite. In this example, the GameObject containing the Sprite and the Sprite Swap component are aligned to match the open hand Sprite in the Skinning Editor. As the thumbs up Sprite is not rigged to the same skeleton, it appears misaligned as its pivot location is not in the same relative position as the original Sprite. To align the unskinned thumbs up Sprite, you must adjust its pivot to match the relative position of the open hand Sprite’s pivot. Note: If a Sprite is rigged to a skeleton, then its individual pivot location is overridden by the influence and position of the bone it is weighted to . To change the pivot position of a Sprite, first select the Sprite in the Sprite Editor, which causes the Sprite panel to appear at the bottom right of the Sprite Editor window. The Sprite panel shows details of the selected Sprite, such as its Name, Position, and Pivot properties. You can select from a dropdown list of predefined pivot options from the Pivot menu. These include options such as Center and Top Left, as well as Custom Pivot (this unlocks the Custom Pivot position property settings, allowing you to input your own custom position for the pivot). In this example, the two swapped Sprites are aligned by changing the Pivot property from Center to Custom Position, and inputting the Custom Pivot position that aligns the thumbs up Sprite with the open hand Sprite. After applying the changes, the swapped Sprite is now aligned with the rest of the actor after the Sprite Swap."

    "keywords": "Actor skinning and weighting workflow The following steps are the general workflow for preparing your actor for animation with the Skinning Editor, after you have imported it into Unity. Follow the steps below to create the bones, generate the meshes, and adjust the weights for your actor. For more specific samples and examples, refer to the samples distributed with the 2D Animation package and the sample documentation included here. Use the Create Bone tool to build the bones of the actor skeleton. With the tool selected, click to define the start-point of the bone. Then move the cursor to where the bone should end, and click again to set the bone’s end-point. After creating a bone, the tool allows you to set the end-point of the second bone and so on, in order to create a chain of bones. To continue a chain of bones from any bone, select the Create Bone tool and click an existing bone, then click its end-point. A new bone is started from the end-point, creating a chain. Alternatively, you can set the start-point of the new bone away from its parent bone. The child bone still belongs to the same chain and this is reflected in the bone hierarchy. A faded link shows the red and blue bones are connected in a chain. After creating the bones of the actor, generate the geometry Mesh for the Sprites. It is recommended to use the Auto Geometry tool to auto-generate the geometry Mesh. With the Auto Geometry tool selected, select a Sprite and then select the Generate For Selected button to generate a Mesh for that Sprite only. To Generate For All Visible Sprites, click the generate button without selecting any Sprite. Refine the generated Meshes further by using the Edit Geometry Geometry tool, or create your own Mesh outline with the Create Vertex and Create Edge Geometry tools. Paint weights onto the Sprite geometry to adjust how much influence a bone has on the vertices of the Mesh. This affects how the mesh deforms when the actor is animated. It is recommended to use the Auto Weights tool to auto-generate the weights. The Auto Weights tool only generates weights for Sprites that have both a geometry Mesh, and bones intersecting their Mesh: The Generate For All Visible button is available when you do not select any specific Sprite. Select it to generate weights for all valid Sprite Meshes in the editor. The Generate For Selected button is available when you have a Sprite selected in the editor. Select it to generate weights for only the selected Sprite. Use the Weight Slider and Weight Brush tools to further adjust the weights of the Mesh vertices. To edit which bones influence a Sprite, select it and then go to the Bone Influence tool. A list of bones currently influencing the Sprite’s Mesh are listed in this panel at the bottom-right of the editor. To remove a bone, select it from the list and select Remove (-) at the bottom right of the list. Select Remove (-) at the bottom right of the panel. To add a bone as an influencer to the currently selected Sprite Mesh, select the bone in the editor window and select Add (+) to add it to the list. To do the reverse and edit which Sprites are being influenced by a bone, select the bone you want to examine, and then go to the Sprite Influence tool. Similarly to the Bone Influence tool, there is an Add (+) and Remove (-) button. Test your rigged actor by posing it with the Preview Pose tool. Move and rotate the different bones to check that the geometry Mesh deforms properly. Previewing poses can also be done while the following tools are selected: the Weight Brush, Weight Slider, Bone Influence, Auto Weights, and Visibility tools. To restore a rigged actor to its original pose, select Reset Pose from the Pose toolbar. Edit the default pose by moving the actor bones and joints with the Edit Bone tool. After you have completed rigging your actor, you are now prepared to animate the actor."

    "title": "Preparing and importing artwork | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Preparing and importing artwork Use the 2D Animation package together with the PSD Importer package to import your artwork for animation. The PSD Importer imports the graphic data from each Photoshop Layer as Sprites, and provides various importer options that prepare your artwork for animation. The PSD Importer only supports the Adobe Photoshop .psb file format, thus it is recommended to create your artwork in Adobe Photoshop or any other graphic software which supports the Adobe .psb file format. When preparing your character or prop artwork, it is recommended to prepare them in a neutral or idle position. Depending on the complexity and use of your animation, it is also recommended to separate the individual parts of the artwork onto different Photoshop Layers (see Example 1 below). The artwork file must be saved in the Adobe Photoshop .psb file format, which is functionally identical to the more common Adobe .psd format, but supports much larger images than the .psd format (up to 300,000 pixels in any dimension). To convert artwork from the .psd format to the .psb format, open and save the .psd files as .psb files in Adobe Photoshop. Example 1: Layered character artwork in Adobe Photoshop. PSD Importer features The PSD Importer has many features and options that prepare the actor for animation. For example, enable the Mosaic option to have Unity automatically generate a Sprite sheet from the imported layers; or enable Character Rig to have Unity generate a Prefab with Sprites generated from the imported source file, with the Sprites arranged into their original positions based on the source file. Refer the PSD Importer's documentation for more information about the different options and their functions. Example 2: The imported actor's layers arranged into a Sprite sheet, and reassembled into their original positions in the generated Prefab. Workflow between 2D Animation and PSD Importer There are several ways to animate with the 2D Animation package, depending on how your artwork is prepared and how your animation will be used in your Unity Project. The 2D Animation package contains sample projects with examples of the different ways to use the package. You can import these using the Package Manager. Refer to the Importing Samples documentation for more information. The following is a general workflow for importing a multilayered and multipart character into Unity for 2D animation with the PSD Importer. For a more detailed specific example, see Rigging a character imported with the PSD Importer: Save your artwork as a .psb file in Adobe Photoshop by selecting the Large Document Format under the Save As menu, or convert an existing .psd file into the .psb format. Import the .psb file into Unity with the PSD Importer, which generates a Prefab containing Sprites based on the layers of the source file. This Prefab is referred to as an 'actor' when used with the 2D Animation package. Select the actor and go to its Inspector window to select its Importer settings. Refer to the PSD Importer documentation and the imported Samples and respective documentation to determine which settings are a best fit for your Project. For example, the following are the recommended import settings for a character with multiple limbs and layers in its source file: Set Texture Type to Sprite(2D and UI). Set Sprite Mode to Multiple. Select the Mosaic check box. Select the Character Rig check box. Select the Use Layer Grouping check box to preserve any Layer Groups in the original .psb source file. Select Apply to apply the above settings. Once the artwork is imported, a Prefab is generated from the graphic data of each layer as individual Sprites, which may be arranged in their original position or as a Sprite sheet depending on the selected importer options. The generated Prefab is referred to as an 'actor' when used with the 2D Animation package. The generated actor is now ready for rigging. Drag the actor Prefab into the Scene view to begin animating. Unity automatically adds the Sprite Skin component to the actor which deforms the Sprite using GameObject Transforms to represent the bones that are rigged and weighted to the Sprite in the Skinning Editor."

You can't create Labels without selecting an existing Category first. Create a new Label for each sprite Select a Category, then drag a or a selection of sprites into an empty space in the Labels column. Dragging the head sprite into the Labels column creates a new Label named head in the selected Category. Unity creates a new Label for each sprite in the selection and gives it the same name as the sprite it references. Note: If an existing Label with the same name already exists at the destination, then the editor appends _X to the new Label's name, where X is the next number in sequence, starting from zero. Dragging in a selection of sprites all named head results in additional Labels created with the _X suffix for each sprite. Replace a Label's sprite reference Drag a sprite onto an existing Label. The editor replaces the sprite reference to the new sprite. The Label's name remains unchanged. Create a single Category with multiple Labels Select multiple sprites from the Project window. Drag the selected sprites into the Categories column to create a new Category. The Category is automatically named after the first sprite in the selection.

Note: If a Label is inherited from a Main Library and exists in an inherited Category, you can't rename the inherited Label to ensure that it matches the original's name in the Main Library. This ensures that the Variant asset can inherit all Categories and Labels from the Main Library. You can create new Labels or edit the sprite reference of an inherited Label as overrides to an inherited Category or Label. Refer to Overrides in the Main Library for more information. Useful editor features The following editor features make it more convenient to edit the contents of a Sprite Library Asset. For more information about all available editor features, refer to the Sprite Library Editor reference. Navigate between different assets When you open a Sprite Library Asset Variant in the Sprite Library Editor, you can use the Sprite Library Editor breadcrumb trail to navigate between different Sprite Library Assets that the opened asset inherits from. Select an asset in the breadcrumb trail to select it in the Project window. Toggle between list or grid view You can view the sprite content of Labels in a list or in a grid. To toggle between these two views, select the respective icon at the lower right of the editor window, and use the slider to adjust the size of the visual preview. Filter Categories and Labels by name Filter the Categories and Labels by entering a text string into the filter bar in the upper right of the window. You can adjust the parameters of the filter by using the filter context menu.

Categories retrieved from the Main Library Asset are grouped under the Inherited foldout group, and all new Categories that exist only in the current Asset are grouped under the Local foldout group. The Labels of the Categories retrieved from the Main Library property can't be renamed or removed. However, you can add new Labels to a Category which was retrieved from the Sprite Library Asset assigned to the Main Library property. You can also edit a Label to change the Sprite that it refers to by selecting the object picker and choosing a different Sprite. It's also possible to drag and drop a Sprite to a Label to change its Sprite.

Use Sprite Library Editor breadcrumbs to navigate between between different Sprite Library Assets that the edited Asset inherits from. After clicking on an Asset in the breadcrums it will be selected in the Project window. Sprite Library component The Sprite Library component defines which Sprite Library Asset a GameObject refers to at runtime. Attach this component to a GameObject or any parent GameObject of a Sprite Resolver component to allow the Sprite Resolver to change the Sprite that is being used by a Sprite Renderer. In the Sprite Library component’s inspector, you can assign the desired Sprite Library Asset to use. By assigning a Sprite Library Asset, the component’s Inspector shows a preview of the content in the Sprite Library Asset Similar to the Sprite Library Editor window, you can add new Categories, change the Sprite a Label refers to, and add a new Sprite Label into the Category in Sprite Library component's Inspector window. Modified Sprites Example: A Sprite retrieved from the Main Library that has been modified. The + icon appears on a Sprite when: A new Label is added to the Sprite Library Asset in a Category retrieved from the Sprite Library Asset property. A Label retrieved from the Sprite Library Asset property has its Sprite reference changed. When assigning a Sprite Library Asset to the Sprite Library Asset property, if the same Category name already exists in the current Sprite Library Asset, then the Labels from both Categories are merged into a single Category. Similarly, any Labels in the same Category that have the same names are merged. The Label uses the Sprite that was referred to in the current Sprite Library Asset instead of the one from the Sprite Library Asset if they are merged. When a Sprite Library Asset is removed from the Sprite Library Asset property, any changes that were made to the current Sprite Library Asset remain. Sprite Resolver component The Sprite Resolver component is attached to each GameObject in the Prefab. The component pulls information from the Sprite Library Asset (assigned to the Sprite Library component at the root of the Prefab). The component contains two properties - Category and Label - and a visual Variant Selector that displays thumbnails of the Sprites contained in the Sprite Library Asset. Inspector view of Sprite Resolver component. Property Function Category Select which Category you want to use a Sprite from for this GameObject.

Smaller values create simpler outlines, while larger values create denser outlines that fit to the Sprite’s outline more accurately. Alpha Tolerance Use the slider to set the alpha value threshold to consider when generating geometry. Pixels with an alpha value lower than the set tolerance value are considered transparent during outline detection when the geometry is generated. Subdivide Use the slider to adjust the tessellation of the Sprite mesh by adding or decreasing the number of vertices inside the generated mesh. Weights Enable to automatically assign weights between the generated geometry mesh and nearby bones. Generate For Selected/Generate For All Visible Select this button to generate a geometry mesh for selected Sprites based on the property settings above. To generate geometry for all Sprites in the Skinning Editor, do not have any Sprite selected when you select this button. Weight tools Vertices in the generated geometry meshes are influenced by different bones which affect how the meshes deform during animation. The percentage of influences from different bones for each vertex is contained in the weight information assigned to that vertex, which you can control with the following Weight tools. To add weights to your Sprites, you can first ensure that there are bones overlaying the Sprites and geometry has been generated. Tool Default Shortcut Function Auto Weights Shift + Z Auto-generate weights between the geometry and bones. When this tool is selected, the Weights panel becomes available at the lower right of the Skinning Editor that displays the available settings and the option to generate weights for.

Hardness Amount of weight applied by the brush per brushstroke. Higher values increase the weight per brushstroke, up to the maximum of 100 where the full weight is applied at once. Step Number of increments needed to apply the full weight of brush. Bone Influences panel The Bone Influences panel displays a list of bones that are currently influencing the selected Sprite mesh. When the Skinning Editor is set to Character mode, the Bone Influences panel allows you to add a bone to the list which includes its influence in the deformation of the selected Sprite’s mesh, or remove a bone from the list which removes its influence instead. To add a bone to the list, select the bone in the Skinning Editor window and then select Add (+) at the lower right of the panel. To remove a bone from the list, select the bone in the list or in the editor window and then select Remove (-). Rearranging bone order You can rearrange the bone order in the Bone Influences panel by selecting and the dragging the respective bone entries up or down the list. The order of the bones in the Bone Influences panel determines the order of the bones on the Sprite Skin component. This is especially important when replacing the Sprite for deformation in the Sprite Renderer, such as when using Sprite Swap, as you can ensure the bone order remains the same between the Sprites and that the correct Transform drives the correct deformation. Sprite Influences panel The Sprite Influences panel displays a list of Sprite meshes that are currently being influenced by the selected bone. When the Skinning Editor is set to Character mode, the Sprite Influences panel allows you to remove an unwanted Sprite mesh from the list so that it’s not influenced by the selected bone. It’s also possible to add a selected Sprite to the list which will include the selected bone’s influence in its deformation. To add a Sprite mesh to the list, select the bone in the Skinning Editor window as well as the Sprite you want to add, and then select Add (+) at the lower right of the panel. To remove a Sprite from the list, select it in the list or in the editor window and then select Remove (-).

Paste Ctrl + V Pastes the copied bone and mesh data to the current selection. Paste Shift + B Use this shortcut to show additional pasting options. Copy and Paste behavior Once you have rigged the skeleton and bone weights of your actor, you can reuse the same rigged skeleton with other Model Prefabs by using the Copy and Paste options on the Rig tools. This is useful if you need to quickly create characters that share the same build and animations. You can only Copy and Paste if the source and destination Model Prefabs have the same number of Sprites and Sprite names. When you Copy and Paste the bone and mesh data, the following occurs: Copied bone data is pasted to the destination. Mesh, weights, and bone association of source Sprite(s) are pasted to destination Sprite(s) with the same names. Copy behavior To copy sprite data, select a sprite and then select Copy. This copies the mesh and bone data associated with that sprite. If no sprite is selected, then this copies the data of all sprites' currently in the Skinning Editor window instead.

Each Sprite’s Bone entry must have a GameObject Transform associated with it for correct deformation. Create Bones The button lets you create GameObject Transform(s) to represent the Sprite’s Bone and assign them to the Root Bone property and the individual Bones entry. The Root Bone that is created is placed as a child of the GameObject of the Sprite Skin. The button is only enabled if the Root Bone property isn't assigned. Reset Bind Pose The button resets the GameObject Transforms assigned in the Bones entry to the bind pose value set up for the Sprite in the Skinning Editor module. Auto Rebind When you enable Auto Rebind, Sprite Skin attempts to automatically locate the GameObject Transform that is needed for the current Sprite assigned to the Sprite Renderer. This is triggered when the Sprite in the Sprite Renderer property is changed. When a rebind is required, the Sprite Skin looks for the GameObject Transform name that matches the bone name in the Skinning Editor module. Example: Selecting a Sprite in the Bone Panel shows the bones currently rigged to and influencing the Sprite, along with their names. In the above example, the Sprite is rigged with three connected bones - starting with 'bone_1' as the root bone, 'bone_2' as a child of 'bone_1', and 'bone_3' as a child of 'bone_2'. For the Sprite Skin component to automatically locate the bones successfully, GameObject Transforms with the same name and hierarchy as shown in the above example must be available in the Scene. By setting the Sprite Skin’s Root Bone property to the correct GameObject Transform, Sprite Skin will then map the GameObject Transform to the Sprite’s rigged bone of the same name. For the Auto Rebind to be successful, the name and the hierarchy of the rigged bones and the GameObject Transforms must match. This means that changing the name of the bones in the Skinning Editor will require you to update the names of the GameObject Transforms to match as well."

    "keywords": "Introduction to Sprite Swap This page introduces what's Sprite Swap, its different uses and its limitations. Sprite Swap refers to changing the rendered Sprite of a GameObject at runtime, which is useful when animating the Sprites that make up a 2D actor or other GameObjects. For example, you can swap the individual Sprites that make up an animated actor to create multiple actors that share the same skeleton (requires the PSD Importer package; or create animation clips by swapping the Sprites at runtime. You can import sample projects for the 2D Animation package by selecting the option in the 2D Animation package window. Refer to the individual Sprite Swap examples pages for more information about these samples. Required assets and components Sprite Swap requires the following Assets and component, which are available with the 2D Animation package: Sprite Library Asset: The Sprite Library Asset contains a set of selected Sprites which are assigned to different Categories and Labels. Sprite Library component: The Sprite Library component determines which Sprite Library Asset a GameObject refers to. Sprite Resolver component: The Sprite Resolver component requests a Sprite registered to the Sprite Library Asset by referring to the Category and Label value of the desired Sprite. Technical limitations The following are technical limitations which you should keep in mind when using Sprite Swap. Skeletal animation limitations If you want to animate your actor and use Sprite Swap with skeletal animation, both sprites that are swapped must have an identical skeleton. Use the Copy and Paste tools of the Skinning Editor to duplicate the bone and skeleton data from one sprite to another to ensure they will swap correctly. Animator limitations In a single Animator Controller, you can't have one Animation Clip animating the Sprite Renderer’s assigned sprite while another Animation Clip animates the Sprite Resolver’s sprite hash. If these two clips are in the same Animator Controller, they will conflict with each other and cause unwanted playback results. Use the following recommended methods to resolve this issue. The first method is to separate the Animation Clips into separate Animator Controllers that contain only clips that animate either a Sprite Renderer’s sprite or the Sprite Resolver’s sprite hash but not both types in the same Animator Controller. The second method is to update all Animation Clips to the same type so that they can all remain in a single Animator Controller. To do so, convert all clips animating a Sprite Renderer’s sprite to animating a Sprite Resolver’s sprite hash, or vice versa. Additional resources Animation Skinning Editor PSD Importer package"

Note: Install the PSD Importer package to use this sample. Open the Scene file 1 Animated Swap.unity to see the sample in action. Initial frame with the hands in thumbs-up position. This sample uses two different source files located in Assets/Samples/2D Animation/[X.Y.Z]/Samples/5 SpriteSwap/Sprites. The Assets used are: dialog.psb dialog gray.psb These Assets are imported with the PSD Importer with its Character Rig property enabled. Both Assets are rigged with the same skeleton, and each Asset has two different Sprites for the hands which are swapped during the animation. Swapped to a frame with the hands open. They are located in Assets/Samples/2D Animation/[X.Y.Z]/Samples/5 Sprite Swap/Sprite Library and are: dialog.spriteLib dialog gray.spriteLib Follow the steps below to reconstruct the sample Scene: Drag both dialog.psb and dialog gray.psb Prefabs from the Project window into the Scene. Add the Sprite Library component to dialog GameObject, then assign the dialog.spriteLib Asset to its Sprite Library Asset property. Add the Sprite Library component to dialog gray GameObject, then assign the dialog gray.spriteLib Asset to its Sprite Library Asset property. Expand the dialog GameObject's hierarchy and disable the R_arm_2 child GameObject. This Asset is not required as it is swapped in during the animation. Go to the R_arm_1 GameObject, and add the Sprite Resolver component. Select the R_arm_2 graphic from the Label drop-down menu or from its thumbnail. Repeat steps 4 to 5 with the dialog gray GameObject. Add the Animator component to the dialog and dialog gray GameObjects. Locate the Dialog Animator Controller Asset in Assets/Samples/2D Animation/[X.Y.Z]/Samples/5 Sprite Swap/Animation/Animators and assign it to the Animator component's Controller property. In this sample, the Sprite Library component is not attached to the same GameObject as the Sprite Resolver component. The Sprite Resolver attempts to locate a Sprite Library component starting from the same GameObject it is on and then traverse up the GameObject hierarchy. This lets a single or multiple Sprite Resolvers use the same Sprite Library component by attaching the Sprite Library component to a common root GameObject that the Sprite Resolver components are attached to. Part Swap This sample demonstrates how to swap Sprite Assets using the API provided by changing the Sprite Resolver data. Open the 2 Part Swap.unity Scene to see the sample in action. In the Scene, each part has three different visual options that can be swapped. The graphic Assets are located in Assets/Samples/2D Animation/[X.Y.Z]/Samples/5 SpriteSwap/Sprites: Knight.psb Skeleton.psb Witch.psb A Sprite Library Asset containing Sprites made from all three graphic Assets above is created. A Category is created for each body part of the actor, with three Entries derived from the three different versions of the character. The Asset is located in Assets/Samples/2D Animation/[X.Y.Z]/Samples/5 SpriteSwap/Sprite Library/Part Swap.spriteLib. Corresponding parts from each of the three versions of the actor, and named accordingly. Attach the Sprite Library component to the KnightRig GameObject in the Scene. Assign the Part Swap.spriteLib Asset to its Sprite Library Asset property. Add the Sprite Resolver component to all Sprite Renderers under the KnightRig GameObject. Assign a Sprite that matches its corresponding GameObject, depending on the body part that GameObject represents. For example, select one of the Sprites in the 'Body' Category for the Sprite Resolver attached to the KnightRig GameObject and so on. With this setup, you can swap any part of the actor to another Sprite individually. Swap part script A custom MonoBehaviour script called SwapPart is attached to the KnightRig GameObject. This script is located in Assets/Samples/2D Animation/[X.Y.Z]/Samples/5 SpriteSwap/Scripts/Runtime/SwapPart.cs. The script holds a reference to a Sprite Library component for retrieval of swappable Sprites. It also holds an array of data that describes the Category of Sprites in the Sprite Library that can be changed by a Sprite Resolver component. When the Swap Part script starts up, it attempts to fetch the Sprite Library Asset that is used by a Sprite Library component. var libraryAsset = spriteLibrary.spriteLibraryAsset; From this Sprite Library Asset, it then fetches the Entries and Label names that are in a Category. var labels = libraryAsset.GetCategoryLabelNames(swapOption.category); This is then used to populate the UI Drop Down list. When a value changes in the UI Drop Down List, it then sets the Sprite Resolver component to use the relevant Sprite. swapOption.spriteResolver.SetCategoryAndLabel(swapOption.category, swapOption.dropdown.options[x].text); Full Skin Swap This sample demonstrates how to swap Sprite visuals using the provided API by changing the Sprite Library Asset referenced by the Sprite Library component. Open the 3 Full Swap.unity Scene to see the sample in action. In the Scene, there are three different visual Asset options that you can swap to. The Assets are located in Assets/Samples/2D Animation/[X.Y.Z]/Samples/5 SpriteSwap/Sprites: Knight.psb Wolf.psb Witch.psb The Sprite Library Assets have identical Categories, Entries, and Label names but with different Sprites selected. The Assets are located in Assets/Samples/2D Animation/[X.Y.Z]/Samples/5 SpriteSwap/Sprite Library. Knight.spriteLib Wolf.spriteLib Witch.spriteLib Attach the Sprite Library component to the KnightRig GameObject. Assign the Knight.spriteLib Asset to its Sprite Library Asset property. Add the Sprite Resolver component to each of the Sprite Renderers under the KnightRig GameObject. Assign a Sprite to each Sprite Resolver that corresponds to the body part they are attached to. For example, the torso Sprite is selected for the Sprite Resolver attached to the torso GameObject. Swap Full Skin Script A custom MonoBehaviour script called SwapFullSkin is attached to the KnightRig GameObject. This script is located in Assets/Samples/2D Animation/[X.Y.Z]/Samples/5 SpriteSwap/Scripts/Runtime/SwapFullSkin.cs Where a value changes in the UI Drop Down List, the component sets the relevant Sprite Library Asset to be used for the Sprite Library component. spriteLibraryTarget.spriteLibraryAsset = spriteLibraries[value]; DLC Swap This sample demonstrates how to swap Sprite visuals by changing the referenced Sprite Library Asset referenced by the Sprite Library component, using the API provided. This sample builds on the Full Skin Swap sample. This difference from the Full Skin Swap method is that the Sprite Library Asset is loaded from an AssetBundle during runtime and added to the Sprite Library component at a later time. Open the 4 DLC Swap.unity Scene to see the sample in action. To ensure the AssetBundle works correctly, check that the Skeleton.spriteLib Asset in Assets/Samples/2D Animation/[X.Y.Z]/Samples/5 SpriteSwap/Sprite Library is labeled with its corresponding AssetBundle tag. The Skeleton.spriteLib Asset labeled with 'skeleton'. Load Swap DLC Script A custom MonoBehaviour script called LoadSwapDLC is attached to the Load DLC GameObject. The script is located in Assets/Samples/2D Animation/[X.Y.Z]/Samples/5 SpriteSwap/Scripts/Runtime/LoadSwapDLC.cs The script starts up when the DLC is loaded, it scan the AssetBundles for any Sprite Library Assets.

The .psb file format has identical functions as the more common Adobe .psd format, with additional support for much larger image sizes. Refer to the PSD Importer package documentation for more information about the importer’s features. Upgrading Sprite Library Assets and Animation Clips The 2D Animation package and its assets are often updated with major and minor tweaks over time. Some asset improvements can be automatically applied when you upgrade to the latest version of the package. However, some of these changes require a manual step in order to have the assets use the latest code path.

(DANB-692) [1.1.5] - 2024-06-19 Fixed Reduced the font size slightly in the importer headers to match other inspector headers in Unity. (DANB-644) Fixed an issue where the Sort Order would not be reset in Animation Clips when making use of the Z-index in Aseprite. [1.1.4] - 2024-05-02 Fixed Fixed an issue where Sprite Renderers would be hidden after transitioning from one Animation Clip to another. Fixed an issue where generated AnimationClips would be 0.01 seconds too long. [1.1.3] - 2024-03-25 Fixed Fixed an issue where the importer would not parse palette data from the \"old palette\" chunks. Fixed an issue where the Physics Shapes would not take the Sprite Rects into account, causing the outline to be wrongly offset. Fixed an issue where .ase/.aseprite files containing z-index data would fail to import. (DANB-608) [1.1.2] - 2024-03-10 Fixed Fixed an issue where the Mosaic padding did not show up in Sprite Sheet import mode. Fixed an issue where using Sprite Padding with individual import mode would misalign the GameObjects in the generated model prefab. Fixed an issue where the Aseprite package would contest with the XR subsystem package over the InternalAPIEditorBridge.005. (UUM-49338) [1.1.1] - 2024-01-03 Fixed Fixed an issue where the Sprite Editor could be opened even though there were no valid texture to open it with.

    "title": "Frequently asked questions | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Frequently asked questions How are the layers sorted in Unity? When an Aseprite file is imported using the Import Mode: Individual, every layer from the source file becomes a GameObject inside the generated model prefab. If the layer is a normal layer (and not a group layer), it has a SpriteRenderer compontent added to it. To make sure each SpriteRenderer renders in the same order as inside of Aseprite, Unity automatically assigns a value to the Order in Layer field on the SpriteRenderer component. This value is a combination of two variables, the order of the layer inside of Aseprite, where the bottom layer has the value of 0 and the top layer has the value of Number of layers, e.g. if the source file contains 5 layers, the top layer will have the value of 5. The second value is the z-index, which can be set per cell in Aseprite. The final formula to calculate the Order in Layer value is: Layer count from the bottom + Z-Index of the current cell. Apart from the Order in Layer value, Unity also adds a Sorting Group component onto the root GameObject of the model prefab, to make sure that every SpriteRenderer within the prefab is sorted together. For more information about general 2D sorting in Unity, see the 2D Sorting page in the Unity manual. How to combine multiple sprite sheets into one? You can make use of Sprite Atlases to combine multiple sprite sheets into a single texture. Read more about Sprite Atlas here. Combining multiple sprite sheets into one is a good way to reduce the draw calls in a scene. Why is my trimmed Aseprite file not trimmed in Unity? When modifying the canvas size, make sure the Trim content outside the canvas checkbox is checked. This way, the stored texture will be cropped to the specified size. How to add events to Animation Clips? Animation Events can be generated by adding user data to Cels inside of Aseprite. Follow these steps to add an Animation Event to a frame: In Aseprite, select any cel in the frame you want to add an event to. Right click on the cel and select Cel Properties. Press the User Data-button to the left of the Opacity slider to bring up the User Data-field. Enter the event name in the following format: event:EventName. E.g. event:OnIdle. Save the file and switch over to Unity. Open the Animation Window and inspect the Animation Clip. You can see that the event has been added to the frame. How to make changes to an Animator Controller? The Aseprite Importer generates an Animator Controller if the Aseprite file contains more than one frame and the Animation Clip checkbox is checked in the importer. This Animator Controller is Read Only, meaning that it cannot be changed. The Animator Controller is Read Only. If you like to have an Animator Controller which you can change, follow these steps: Select an Aseprite file in Unity. Press the Export Animation Assets-button. In the popup, make sure the Animator Controller checkbox is checked. Leave the Animation Clips checkbox unchecked if you do not wish to edit any of the clips. Press Export and select a folder to place the Asset(s) into. An Animator Controller should now be located in the selected folder. If the Animation Clip checkbox was left unchecked, all the states within the Animator Controller are linked back to the Aseprite file, meaning that the clips will stay up to date with any changes made in Aseprite. Do note that if you add a new tag in Aseprite, you need to add the resulting Animation Clip to the exported Animator Controller, as this will not happen automatically. How to inject custom assets on import? The Aseprite Importer comes with an event, OnPostAsepriteImport, which is fired at the end of the import process. This event can be used to inject or change the generated assets when importing an Aseprite file. using UnityEditor; using UnityEditor.U2D.Aseprite; using UnityEngine; public class GameObjectInjector : AssetPostprocessor { void OnPreprocessAsset() { if (assetImporter is AsepriteImporter aseImporter) aseImporter.OnPostAsepriteImport += OnPostAsepriteImport; } static void OnPostAsepriteImport(AsepriteImporter.ImportEventArgs args) { var myGo = new GameObject(\"MyGameObject\"); args.context.AddObjectToAsset(myGo.name, myGo); } }"

Aseprite Importer Inspector properties General Property Description Import Mode How the file should be imported. This is set to Animated Sprite by default. Sprite Sheet The file is imported as a Sprite Sheet, and can be sliced up in the Sprite Editor. Animated Sprite The file is imported with animation in mind. Animation assets are generated and attached to a model prefab on import. Pixels Per Unit Sets the number of pixels that equals one Unity unit. Mesh Type Sets the Mesh type that Unity generates for the Sprite. This is set to Tight by default. Full Rect Unity maps the Sprite onto a rectangular Mesh. Tight Unity generates a Mesh based on the outline of the Sprite. If the Sprite is smaller than 32 x 32 pixels, Unity always maps it onto a Full Rect quad Mesh, even if you select Tight. Generate Physics Shape Generates a default physics shape from the outline of the Sprite/s when a physics shape has not been set in the Sprite Editor. Layer import Property Description Include Hidden Layers Enable this property to include the hidden layers of the .ase/.asperite file in the import. This property is set to False by default. Import Mode Use this property to specify how the layers from the source file are imported. This property is set to Merge Frame by default. Individual Layers Every layer per frame generates a Sprite. Merge Frame This is the default option. All layers per frame are merged into one Sprite. Pivot Space Select the space pivots should be calculated in. This property is set to Canvas by default. Canvas Calculate the pivot based on where the Sprite is positioned on the source asset's canvas. This is useful if the Sprite is being swapped out in an animation. Local This is the normal pivot space used when importing a standard image in Unity. Pivot Alignment How a Sprite's graphic rectangle is aligned with its pivot point. This property is set Bottom by default. Mosaic Padding External padding between each SpriteRect. This property is set 4 pixels by default. Sprite Padding Internal padding within each SpriteRect. This property is set 0 pixels by default. Generate assets Property Description Model Prefab Enable this property to generate a model prefab setup to look like the first frame in Aseprite. This property is set to True by default. Sorting Group Add a Sorting Group component to the root of the generated model prefab if it has more than one Sprite Renderer. This property is set to True by default. Shadow Casters Enable this property to add Shadow Casters to all GameObjects with a SpriteRenderer. This property is set to False by default. Note that this checkbox is only available in Unity 2023.1 and newer. Animation Clips Enable this property to generate Animation Clips based on the frame data in the file. Every tag in Aseprite generates one Animation Clip. If no tag is present, one Animation Clip is generated which covers all frames in the file. The Animation speed is based on the Constant Frame Rate defined in Aseprite. The length is based on the number of frames included in the tag/file. This property is set to True by default. Export Animation Assets The Animator Controller and the Animation Clips are generated as Read Only assets. This option can be used to export editable versions of these assets. Aseprite Importer Preferences The Aseprite Importer Preferences can be found at Unity > Settings > 2D > Aseprite Importer. Aseprite Importer Preferences Property Description Background import Enable this property to enable asset import when the Unity Editor is in the background. This property is set to True by default."

    "keywords": "2D Pixel Perfect The 2D Pixel Perfect package contains the Pixel Perfect Camera component, which ensures your pixel art remains crisp and clear at different resolutions, and stable in motion. It is a single component that makes all the calculations Unity needs to scale the viewport with resolution changes, so that you don’t need to do it manually. You can use the component settings to adjust the definition of the rendered pixel art within the camera viewport, and you can use the Run in Edit Mode feature to preview any changes immediately in the Game view. Attach the Pixel Perfect Camera component to the main Camera GameObject in the Scene, it is represented by two green bounding boxes centered on the Camera gizmo in the Scene view. The solid green bounding box shows the visible area in Game view, while the dotted bounding box shows the Reference Resolution. The Reference Resolution is the original resolution your Assets are designed for, its effect on the component's functions is detailed further in the documentation. Before using the component, first ensure your Sprites are prepared correctly for best results with the the following steps. Preparing Your Sprites After importing your textures into the project as Sprites, set all Sprites to the same Pixels Per Unit value. In the Sprites' Inspector window, set their Filter Mode to ‘Point’. Set their Compression to 'None'. Follow the steps below to correctly set the pivot for a Sprite Open the Sprite Editor for the selected Sprite. If __Sprite Mode __is set to ‘Multiple’ and there are multiple Sprite elements, then you need to set a pivot point for each individual Sprite element. Under the Sprite settings, set Pivot to ‘Custom’, then set Pivot Unit Mode to ‘Pixels’. This allows you to set the pivot point's coordinates in pixels, or drag the pivot point around freely in the Sprite Editor and have it automatically snap to pixel corners. Repeat for each Sprite element as necessary. Snap Settings To ensure the pixelated movement of Sprites are consistent with each other, follow the below steps to set the proper snap settings for your project. To open the Snap settings, go to Edit > Snap Settings. Set the Move X/Y/Z properties to 1 divided by the Pixel Perfect Camera’s Asset Pixels Per Unit (PPU) value. For example, if the Asset PPU is 100, you should set the Move X/Y/Z properties to 0.01 (1 / 100 = 0.01). Unity does not apply Snap settings retroactively. If there are any pre-existing GameObjects in the Scene, select each of them and select Snap All Axes to apply the Snap settings. Properties The component's Inspector window Property Function Asset Pixels Per Unit This is the amount of pixels that make up one unit of the Scene. Match this value to the Pixels Per Unit values of all Sprites in the Scene. Reference Resolution This is the original resolution your Assets are designed for. Upscale Render Texture Enable this property to create a temporary rendered texture of the Scene close-to or at the Reference Resolution, which is then upscaled. Pixel Snapping (only available when ‘Upscale Render Texture’ is disabled) Enable this feature to snap Sprite Renderers to a grid in world space at render-time. The grid size is based on the Assets’ Pixels Per Unit value. Crop Frame Crops the viewport with black bars to match the Reference Resolution along the checked axis. Check X to add horizontal black bars, and Y to add vertical black bars. For more information and a visual example, refer to the Property Details below. Stretch Fill (available when both X and Y are checked) Enable to expand the viewport to fit the screen resolution while maintaining the viewport's aspect ratio. Run In Edit Mode Enable this checkbox to preview Camera setting changes in Edit Mode. This causes constant changes to the Scene while active. Current Pixel Ratio (available when ‘Run In Edit Mode’ is enabled) Shows the size ratio of the rendered Sprites compared to their original size. Additional Property Details Reference Resolution This is the original resolution your Assets are designed for. Scaling up Scenes and Assets from this resolution preserves your pixel art cleanly at higher resolutions. Upscale Render Texture By default, the Scene is rendered at the pixel perfect resolution closest to the full screen resolution. Enable this option to have the Scene rendered to a temporary texture set as close as possible to the Reference Resolution, while maintaining the full screen aspect ratio. This temporary texture is then upscaled to fit the entire screen. The result is unaliased and unrotated pixels, which may be a desirable visual style for certain game projects. Pixel Snapping Enable this feature to snap Sprite Renderers to a grid in world space at render-time. The grid size is based on the Assets Pixels Per Unit value. Pixel Snapping prevents subpixel movement and make Sprites appear to move in pixel-by-pixel increments. This does not affect any GameObjects' Transform positions. Crop Frame Crops the viewport along the checked axis with black bars to match the Reference Resolution. Black bars are added to make the Game view fit the full screen resolution. Uncropped Cropped Cinemachine Extension As both the Pixel Perfect Camera and Cinemachine modify a Camera’s orthographic size, using these two systems together in a single Scene would cause them to fight for control over the Camera and likely produce unwanted results. To solve this incompatibility, add the Cinemachine Pixel Perfect extension to your virtual cameras. You can find more information about the extension’s features in the Cinemachine documentation."

    "title": "How the PSD Importer uses SpriteRect data | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "How the PSD Importer uses SpriteRect data The PSD Importer can store five separate sets of SpriteRect data, with one set for each of the five combinations of Importer property settings below: When Sprite Mode is set to Single. When Sprite Mode is set to Multiple. When Sprite Mode is set to Multiple, and Individual Sprites (Mosaic) is enabled. When Sprite Mode is set to Multiple, both Individual Sprites (Mosaic) and Use as Rig are enabled, and there is no Skeleton Asset assigned as the Main Skeleton. When Sprite Mode is set to Multiple, both Individual Sprites (Mosaic) and Use as Rig are enabled, and a Skeleton Asset is assigned as the Main Skeleton. Each set of data is persistent, and does not affect or overwrite the data of other sets. This means you can save different SpriteRect data for different importer settings for the same source file. The SpriteRect data persists even if you modify the dimensions and position of images in the source file, as long as the original Layer ID of the source layers remains the same. Modifying SpriteRect data The SpriteRect defines the location of the Sprite on the Texture that Unity generates from the imported source file. You can modify the location and size of each SpriteRect in the Sprite Editor. Moving the SpriteRect Example 1: Original SpriteRect location of the ‘head’ Sprite on the combined Sprite sheet Texture. Example 2: Drag the corners of the SpriteRect to modify its dimensions and location, or enter the coordinates and dimensions in the Sprite panel. A SpriteRect’s modified dimensions and location on the Texture is reflected for its respective Sprite in the Scene view. Original character prefab and its ‘head’ Sprite with unmodified SpriteRect data. Character prefab with its ‘head’ Sprite’s SpriteRect data modified. SpriteRect follows the position of its source layer When you enable the Individual Sprites (Mosaic) importer setting, the PSD Importer arranges the different layers of the source file together to form a single combined Texture when it is imported. The importer generates a SpriteRect for each of these imported layers which follows the position of its associated layer wherever that layer is placed in the combined Mosaic Texture. Before example: The SpriteRect of the ‘head’ layer after moving its SpriteRect from its original position. After example: Some of the layers are hidden in the source file before it is reimported into the Editor. The reimported Texture is different from the original, but the 'head' layer's SpriteRect follows its source layer to its placement in the new Texture. Resizing the source file or image Note that a SpriteRect’s size and position remains the same if you change the image or canvas size of its source layer in the source file. You must manually edit the size and position of the SpriteRect in the Sprite Editor, or select and apply the Automatic Reslice option to regenerate the SpriteRect completely from the source file. Before example: Original position and size of the SpriteRect for the generated ‘head’ Sprite from the 'head' layer. After example: After increasing the size of the 'head' layer, the SpriteRect's position and size remains the same. SpriteRect data persists until you manually delete the SpriteRect, or select the Automatic Reslice option and apply it in the importer settings. When you do this, Unity discards all user modifications for the current set of SpriteRect data and regenerates all the SpriteRects from the current source file. Summary of source file modifications and their effects on SpriteRect data Modification to the source file Effect on SpriteRect data Add a new layer or enable layer visibility The PSD importer automatically generates a new Sprite from the new layer, or newly visible layer, with its associated SpriteRect. Delete a layer or disable layer visibility The PSD Importer deletes the associated Sprite and SpriteRect from the Project file. Rename a layer By default, the SpriteRect copies the new name of its source layer. However if you rename the SpriteRect in the Sprite Editor, then it retains its modified name and does not copy the source layer’s new name. Change a layer or canvas size When a source layer's size changes, the size and position of its related SpriteRect remain the same and do not reflect the changes made to its source layer. To make the SpriteRect reflect the changes made to its source layer, manually edit the SpriteRect’s dimensions in the Sprite Editor, or go to the PSD Importer settings and select and apply the Automatic Reslice option. Name collision errors A name collision error occurs when two or more layers have the same name. This can happen for the following reasons: Two or more layers in the imported source file have the same name. However, Photoshop group layers with the same names do not cause this issue. A new layer that the PSD Importer creates in the source file has the same name as a SpriteRect you have created or modified. A layer is renamed to the same name as a SpriteRect you have modified. A previously hidden layer with the same name as an existing SpriteRect becomes visible and Unity imports it. When a name collision occurs, one SpriteRect retains the original name while the other is appended with a running number to the others (starting with 1). Which SpriteRect retains their original name is based on the following priority: A SpriteRect you have created or modified. The first layer in the source file, starting from the bottom of the layer stack. Currently existing SpriteRects in the Project."

    "keywords": "#PSD Importer Inspector properties The PSD Importer is available after you import a .psb file into your Project. Select the .psb Asset file and set its Texture Type to Sprite (2D and UI). The PSD Importer properties are split between two main tabs, with the following properties available. PSD Importer Inspector properties ##Settings tab The Settings tab allows you to customize how the PSD Importer imports a file. The settings are categorized into individual section fold-outs. ###General Property Description Texture Type Select Sprite (2D and UI) to import the Texture as a Sprite. The is required to begin using the imported Texture with the 2D Animation package. Sprite Mode Use this property to specify how Unity extracts the Sprite graphic from the image. This property is set to Multiple by default. Single Select this option to have Unity treat the imported Texture as a single Sprite Asset without multiple individual parts. This is ideal for characters which are drawn on a single layer in the source file instead of being split onto multiple layers. Multiple This is the default option. Select this option to have Unity create a Sprite for each layer in the source file. This is ideal for complex artwork which has different parts split between multiple layers in the source file, and prepares the imported Textures for animation with the 2D Animation package. Pixels Per Unit Sets the number of pixels that equal to one Unity unit. Mesh Type Sets the Mesh type that Unity generates for the Sprite. This is set to Tight by default. Full Rect Unity maps the Sprite onto a rectangular Mesh. Tight Unity generates a Mesh based on the outline of the Sprite. If the Sprite is smaller than 32 x 32 pixels, Unity always maps it onto a Full Rect quad Mesh, even if you select Tight. Extrude Edges Use the slider to determine how much to extend the Mesh from the edge of the Sprite. Generate Physics Shape Enable this option to generate a default [Physics Shape](https://docs.unity3d.com/2017.4/Documentation/Manual/SpritePhysicsShapeEditor.html) from the outline of the Sprite, if a [Custom Physics Shape](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/CustomPhysicsShape.html) has not be defined Automatic Reslice This is available only when the Import Mode is set to Individual Sprites (Mosaic). Enable this setting to regenerate the Sprite from the imported layers and clear any changes you have made to the Sprite and its metadata. ####Automatic Reslice Enable this setting to discard all user modifications for the current set of SpriteRect data and regenerate all SpriteRects based on the current source file. Extra SpriteRect metadata (such as weights and bones data) persist if they remain valid with the regenerated SpriteRects. ###Layer Import The following section is only available if the Texture Type is set to Multiple. Property Description Include Hidden Layers Enable this property to include the hidden layers of the .psb file in the import. This produces the same import result as making all layers visible in the source file unhiding all layers in the source file before you importing it into Unity. Clear this option if you want to only import the visible layers in the .psb file. Keep Duplicate Name Enable this setting to make the PSD Importer generate Sprites from the source files with the exact same name as their source layers, even when there are multiple layers with the same name. Use Layer Group This setting is only available when you enable Character Rig. Enable this setting to make the importer generate a Prefab that follows the layer and grouping hierarchy of the imported .psb. file. Layer Mapping Select this option to use the internal ID provided by the .psb file to map between the .psb file’s layer and the generated Sprite. Use Layer ID Select this to only import the visible layers in the .psb file. Use Layer Name Select this option to use the name of the layer in the .psb file to map between the .psb file’s layer and the generated Sprite. Note that for this option to work correctly, each layer's name needs to be unique. Duplicated names might cause layers to be mapped to the wrong Sprite. Use Layer Name (Case Sensitive) Select this option to use the name of the layer (with case sensitivity) in the .psb file to map between the .psb file’s layer and the generated Sprite. Note that for this option to work correctly, each layer's name needs to be unique. Duplicated names might cause layers to be mapped to the wrong Sprite. Import Mode Use this property to specify how the layers from the source file are imported. This property is set Individual Sprites (Mosaic) by default. Individual Sprites (Mosaic) Select this option to have the PSD Importer generate individual Sprites from the individual layers of the source file, and combines them into a single Texture in a Sprite sheet layout. Merged Select this to have the PSD Importer generate a Texture with all layers merged. Mosaic Padding Settings to control the padding space between each layer in the texture when Import Mode is set to Individual Sprites (Mosaic). Sprite Padding Settings to increase the size of each Sprite's rect in the texture when Import Mode is set to Individual Sprites (Mosaic). ####Individual Sprites (Mosaic) Enable this to have the PSD Importer attempt to create a Texture with each layer from the source file laid out in a mosaic manner. Individual layers are imported as separate Sprites merged into a single Texture in the form of a mosaic. ####Merged Enable this option to have the PSD Importer create a Texture with the layers from the Photoshop source file as if all layers were flattened. ####Keep Duplicate Names Unity's default import behavior when there are duplicate names is to append \"_[number]\" to the Sprites and SpriteRects it generates from source layers with identical names. Enable this feature to instead have Unity give both Sprites and SpriteRects the exact same name as their source layer, even when they are duplicate names. ####Layer Group By default, the importer only generates GameObjects for layers in the source file. This is for performance reasons to minimize the number of GameObjects needed for the Prefab. The generated Prefab with Layer Group set to Ignore Layer Groups. To include and maintain the group and hierarchy structure as per the source file, you can set the Layer Group to As Per Source File, as shown in the example below. The generated Prefab of the same source file with Layer Group set to As Per Source File. ###Character Rig This section is only available if the Texture Type is set to Multiple and Import Mode is set to Individual Sprites (Mosaic). Property Description Use as Rig Enable this property to have the PSD Importer generate a Prefab based on the imported source file. The PSD Importer generates Sprites from the imported layers of the source file, and the Sprites’ hierarchy and positions are based on their layer hierarchy and their positions in the source file. Main Skeleton This is only available when Use as Rig is enabled. Assign the Skeleton Asset that this character Prefab’s bone hierarchy will reference. If no Skeleton Asset is assigned, the importer will automatically generate a Skeleton Asset as a sub-Asset of this character. The Skeleton Asset contains the bone hierarchy of the Asset that was defined in the 2D Animation package's Skinning Editor (refer to Skeleton Sharing for more information). Pivot This is only available when Use as Rig is enabled. Select the pivot point of the Sprite. Custom Define the X and Y coordinates of a custom Pivot location. (All location choices) Select the location where you want to place the pivot on the Sprite from the dropdown menu. ####Use as Rig Enable this property to have the PSD Importer generate a Prefab containing Sprites based on the layers of the imported source file. The PSD Importer also automatically gives the Sprites an Order in Layer value that sorts them according to their positions in the layer hierarchy in the source file. As a result, the generated Prefab recreates the arrangement and appearance of the assets in the original source file as closely as possible. The name of each Sprite in the Prefab is the same as the source layer it is based on, unless a name collision error occurs, which is usually due to duplicate names in the source layers. If the Sprite contains bone or weight data, the PSD Importer automatically adds the Sprite Skin component to it. This happens if the Sprite has been rigged with bones and weights in the Skinning Editor already and the source file is being reimported, or you have manually copied and pasted the bone and weight data onto the Sprites. ####Main Skeleton A skeleton Asset (.skeleton) is an Asset that contains the bone hierarchy structure that can be animated with the 2D Animation package. The Main Skeleton property is only available when you import a .psb file with the Use As Rig importer setting enabled. After importing the .psb file, assign a .skeleton Asset to the Main Skeleton property to have the generated prefab character be automatically rigged with the bone hierarchy structure contained in that .skeleton Asset. If there is no .skeleton Asset assigned to the importer’s Main Skeleton property, then a .skeleton Asset is automatically generated as a of the imported source file and it will be named ‘[Asset File Name] Skeleton’. You can share .skeleton Assets between different generated Prefabs by assigning the same .skeleton as their Main Skeleton property when they're imported. When you open and edit the character in 2D Animation package’s Skinning Editor, the module will display the bone hierarchy provided by the skeleton Asset assigned to Main Skeleton for rigging. ##Layer Management Tab The Layer Management Tab allows you to customize how the Importer imports the layers from the Photoshop file. ###Layer hierarchy tree Group layers in Photoshop are represented with a fold-out folder icon in the hierarchy tree of the Layer Management tab, while regular Photoshop layers in Photoshop represented only by their names. ###Layer visibility Groups or layers that are hidden in the source file are indicated with different color text compared to visible groups or layers. ###Layer Importing The checkbox on each Group/Layer indicates if the Group or Layer from the Photoshop file should be imported. The Group or Layer will be imported when the checkbox is selected. Clear the Include Hidden Layers option in the Layer Management Tab or Settings Tab will only import visible layers from the source file. If a hidden group or layer is mark for import in this state, a warning icon will appear. To import a hidden layer, select the Include Hidden Layers checkbox either in the Settings Tab or in the Layer Management Tab To batch select or deselect layers, you can use the drop down menu located at header of the Layer Importing column. Collapsing Groups The Photoshop layers in a Group can be collapsed into a single Sprite when imported. Hover the cursor over a Group Layer and the Collapse icon appears on its left. Collapse icon with arrow facing down. Click the icon to indicate that the layers in the selected Group should be imported as a single Sprite. Uncollapsing Groups Hovering over a Collapsed Group layer reveals the Uncollapse icon (the arrow faces upwards). Select the icon again to uncollapse the Group layer and to import all Layers in the Group as separate Sprites. Subgroups within Group layers If a Group contains other Group layers and is collapsed, then the layers in the subgroups will also be collapsed into a single Sprite. If a child Group is currently set to be collapsed, then the parent group will have separate icons indicating that are child Groups currently set to collapse."

    "title": "Overview | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Overview The PSD Importer is an Asset importer that imports Adobe Photoshop .psb files into Unity, and generates a Prefab of Sprites based on the imported source file. The .psb file format is functionally identical to the more common Adobe .psd format, but supports much larger images than the .psd format (up to 300,000 pixels in any dimension). To convert existing artwork from .psd to .psb format, you can open them in Adobe Photoshop and then save them as .psb files. Importing .psb files with the PSD Importer allows you to use features such as Mosaic (to automatically generate a Sprite sheet from the imported layers) and Character Rig (to reassemble the Sprites of a character as they are arranged in their source files). The PSD Importer currently only supports two Texture Modes: Default and Sprite. Note: The Sprite Library Asset is no longer editable from the Skinning Editor of the 2D Animation from version 6.0 onwards as the Category and Label options have been removed from the Sprite Visibility panel. However, the PSD Importer will continue to automatically generate Sprite Library Assets if relevant data from a previous version is present. Supported and unsupported Photoshop effects When importing a .psb file into Unity with the PSD Importer, the importer generates a prefab of Sprites based on the image and layer data of the imported .psb file. To ensure the importer imports the file correctly, ensure that the Photoshop file is saved with Maximize Compatibility enabled. The PSD Importer does not support all of Photoshop’s layer and visual effects or features. The PSD Importer ignores the following Photoshop layer properties and visual effects when it generates the Sprites and prefab: Channels Blend Modes Layer Opacity Effects If you want to add visual effects to the generated Sprites, you can add additional Textures to the Sprites with the Sprite Editor's Secondary Textures module. Shaders can sample these Secondary Textures to apply additional effects to the Sprite, such as normal mapping. Refer to the Sprite Editor: Secondary Textures documentation for more information."

    "title": "Skeleton sharing | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Skeleton sharing You can share .skeleton Assets between different imported Assets by assigning the .skeleton Asset from one to the other's Main Skeleton property. This feature can be used together with the 2D Animation package to edit the bones of the .skeleton Assets in the 2D Animation package's Skinning Editor. To demonstrate how to skeleton sharing, refer to the following example of two actors (characters or other Assets imported for animation with the 2D Animation package) that were imported into Unity with the PSD Importer called 'Primary' and 'Variant'. The goal is to share the .skeleton Asset of 'Primary' with 'Variant'. | --|-- Primary | Variant The 2D Animation package is required to create and edit the bones of the .skeleton Assets of imported Assets. In this example, the bones of 'Primary' are created and rigged in 2D Animation's Skinning Editor (refer to the 2D Animation package documentation for further information). A bone hierarchy connected together to form the skeleton of 'Primary'. When importing an Asset without anything set in the Main Skeleton property, the PSD Importer generates a .skeleton Asset for the Asset and automatically names it as '[Asset File Name] Skeleton'. Any bones rigged for 'Primary' is saved to the .skeleton Asset 'Primary Skeleton'. To share the 'Primary Skeleton' with 'Variant', select 'Variant' and go to its PSD Importer settings. Assign 'Primary Skeleton' to the Main Skeleton property to have 'Variant' reference that .skeleton Asset as its own bone hierarchy. The Bone tools are greyed out and unavailable when opening 'Variant' in the Skinning Editor. When an actor references another actor's .skeleton Asset instead of its own, the Bone Tools in the Skinning Editor are disabled. To edit the bones, open the original actor (that the .skeleton Asset belongs to) in the Skinning Editor and edit the bones. Any changes to the original .skeleton Asset is reflected in any actor which references it. In this example, changes made to 'Primary Skeleton' are reflected in the 'Variant' actor's bone hierarchy ."

    "title": "Generating Custom Geometry | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Generating Custom Geometry The Custom Geometry feature is found in the Sprite Shape Controller. It allows you to use a custom script to generate or modify Sprite Shape geometry. The custom script is written as a ScriptableObject and is reusable. API Examples ###Generating new geometry To generate new geometry, refer to the following example code. public abstract class SpriteShapeGeometryCreator : ScriptableObject { public abstract int GetVertexArrayCount(SpriteShapeController spriteShapeController); public abstract JobHandle MakeCreatorJob(SpriteShapeController spriteShapeController, NativeArray<ushort> indices, NativeSlice<Vector3> positions, NativeSlice<Vector2> texCoords, NativeSlice<Vector4> tangents, NativeArray<SpriteShapeSegment> segments, NativeArray<float2> colliderData); } Note: The default generator script that ships with the Sprite Shape package is itself written as a SpriteShapeGeometryCreator (refer to Runtime/SpriteShapeDefaultCreator.cs). Any custom SpriteShapeGeometryCreator set through the script or Inspector will override this default Object. ###Modifying existing geometry To modify generated geometry, refer to the following example code. public abstract class SpriteShapeGeometryModifier : ScriptableObject { public abstract JobHandle MakeModifierJob(JobHandle generator, SpriteShapeController spriteShapeController, NativeArray<ushort> indices, NativeSlice<Vector3> positions, NativeSlice<Vector2> texCoords, NativeSlice<Vector4> tangents, NativeArray<SpriteShapeSegment> segments, NativeArray<float2> colliderData); } Note: SpriteShapeGeometryModifier is only applicable when either: SpriteShapeDefaultCreator is used and the vertex data only needs modification. Or a custom SpriteShapeGeometryCreator is used with default channels accepted in MakeCreatorJob. SpriteShapeGeometryModifier cannot be used when MakeCreatorJob creates a Job with custom Channel data. Examples by usage Creating a simple quad with the size of the Bounds with SpriteShapeGeometryCreator: // A simple C# job to generate a quad. public struct CreatorJob : IJob { // Indices of the generated triangles. public NativeArray<ushort> indices; // Vertex positions. public NativeSlice<Vector3> positions; // Texture Coordinates. public NativeSlice<Vector2> texCoords; // Sub-meshes of generated geometry. public NativeArray<UnityEngine.U2D.SpriteShapeSegment> segments; // Input Bounds. public Bounds bounds; public void Execute() { // Generate Positions/TexCoords/Indices for the Quad. positions[0] = bounds.min; texCoords[0] = Vector2.zero; positions[1] = bounds.max; texCoords[1] = Vector2.one; positions[2] = new Vector3(bounds.min.x, bounds.max.y, 0); texCoords[2] = new Vector2(0, 1); positions[3] = new Vector3(bounds.max.x, bounds.min.y, 0); texCoords[3] = new Vector2(1, 0); indices[0] = indices[3] = 0; indices[1] = indices[4] = 1; indices[2] = 2; indices[5] = 3; // Set the only sub-mesh (quad) var seg = segments[0]; seg.geomIndex = seg.spriteIndex = 0; seg.indexCount = 6; seg.vertexCount = 4; segments[0] = seg; // Reset other sub-meshes. seg.geomIndex = seg.indexCount = seg.spriteIndex = seg.vertexCount = 0; for (int i = 1; i < segments.Length; ++i) segments[i] = seg; } } [CreateAssetMenu(fileName = \"SpriteShapeQuad\", menuName = \"ScriptableObjects/SpriteShapeQuad\", order = 1)] public class SpriteShapeQuad : SpriteShapeGeometryCreator { public override int GetVertexArrayCount(SpriteShapeController sc) { // Set the maximum size required for the Vertices. return 64; } public override JobHandle MakeCreatorJob(SpriteShapeController sc, NativeArray<ushort> indices, NativeSlice<Vector3> positions, NativeSlice<Vector2> texCoords, NativeSlice<Vector4> tangents, NativeArray<UnityEngine.U2D.SpriteShapeSegment> segments, NativeArray<float2> colliderData) { NativeArray<Bounds> bounds = sc.spriteShapeRenderer.GetBounds(); var spline = sc.spline; int pointCount = spline.GetPointCount(); Bounds bds = new Bounds(spline.GetPosition(0), spline.GetPosition(0)); for (int i = 0; i < pointCount; ++i) bds.Encapsulate(spline.GetPosition(i)); bounds[0] = bds; var cj = new CreatorJob() {indices = indices, positions = positions, texCoords = texCoords, segments = segments, bounds = bds}; var jh = cj.Schedule(); return jh; } } Changing UV data with SpriteShapeGeometryModifier: // A simple C# job to move the UV along the x-axis. If this is called repeatedly each frame it creates UV Animation effect. To get this called each frame, use RefreshSpriteShape API of SpriteShapeController. public struct UVAnimatorJob : IJob { // We are only modifying UV data. public NativeSlice<Vector2> uvs; // Offset to move x coordinates of UV. public float offset; public void Execute() { // Move x coordinates of UV data. for (int i = 0; i < uvs.Length; ++i) { var uv = uvs[i]; uv.x = (uv.x + offset) % 1.0f; uvs[i] = uv; } } } [CreateAssetMenu(fileName = \"SpriteShapeUVAnimator\", menuName = \"ScriptableObjects/SpriteShapeUVAnimator\", order = 1)] public class SpriteShapeUVAnimator : SpriteShapeGeometryModifier { public override JobHandle MakeModifierJob(JobHandle generator, SpriteShapeController spriteShapeController, NativeArray<ushort> indices, NativeSlice<Vector3> positions, NativeSlice<Vector2> texCoords, NativeSlice<Vector4> tangents, NativeArray<SpriteShapeSegment> segments, NativeArray<float2> colliderData) { var mj = new UVAnimatorJob(){ uvs = texCoords, offset = UnityEngine.Time.time}; var jh = mj.Schedule(generator); return jh; } } Advanced usage The following is an example of advanced usage of the API by creating geometry with vertex colors. In the function MakeCreatorJob below, GetChannels is invoked to get additional colors other than the default. The input parameters for MakeCreatorJob are overwritten by the GetChannels function. Note: Only SpriteShapeGeometryCreator can be used when updating any other channels that are not part of the MakeCreatorJob parameters. public struct ColorCreatorJob : IJob { // Indices of the generated triangles. public NativeArray<ushort> indices; // Vertex positions. public NativeSlice<Vector3> positions; // Texture Coordinates. public NativeSlice<Vector2> texCoords; // Color of Vertces. public NativeSlice<Color32> colors; // Sub-meshes of generated geometry. public NativeArray<UnityEngine.U2D.SpriteShapeSegment> segments; // Input Bounds. public Bounds bounds; public void Execute() { // Generate Positions/TexCoords/Indices for the Quad. positions[0] = bounds.min; texCoords[0] = Vector2.zero; colors[0] = Color.red; positions[1] = bounds.max; texCoords[1] = Vector2.one; colors[1] = Color.blue; positions[2] = new Vector3(bounds.min.x, bounds.max.y, 0); texCoords[2] = new Vector2(0, 1); colors[2] = Color.green; positions[3] = new Vector3(bounds.max.x, bounds.min.y, 0); texCoords[3] = new Vector2(1, 0); colors[3] = Color.yellow; indices[0] = indices[3] = 0; indices[1] = indices[4] = 1; indices[2] = 2; indices[5] = 3; // Set the only sub-mesh (quad) var seg = segments[0]; seg.geomIndex = seg.spriteIndex = 0; seg.indexCount = 6; seg.vertexCount = 4; segments[0] = seg; // Reset other sub-meshes. seg.geomIndex = seg.indexCount = seg.spriteIndex = seg.vertexCount = 0; for (int i = 1; i < segments.Length; ++i) segments[i] = seg; } } [CreateAssetMenu(fileName = \"SpriteShapeColorQuad\", menuName = \"ScriptableObjects/SpriteShapeColorQuad\", order = 1)] public class SpriteShapeColorQuad : SpriteShapeGeometryCreator { public override int GetVertexArrayCount(SpriteShapeController sc) { return 64; } public override JobHandle MakeCreatorJob(SpriteShapeController sc, NativeArray<ushort> indices, NativeSlice<Vector3> positions, NativeSlice<Vector2> texCoords, NativeSlice<Vector4> tangents, NativeArray<UnityEngine.U2D.SpriteShapeSegment> segments, NativeArray<float2> colliderData) { NativeArray<Bounds> bounds = sc.spriteShapeRenderer.GetBounds(); var spline = sc.spline; int pointCount = spline.GetPointCount(); Bounds bds = new Bounds(spline.GetPosition(0), spline.GetPosition(0)); for (int i = 0; i < pointCount; ++i) bds.Encapsulate(spline.GetPosition(i)); NativeSlice<Color32> colors = default(NativeSlice<Color32>); sc.spriteShapeRenderer.GetChannels(32000, out indices, out positions, out texCoords, out colors); var cj = new ColorCreatorJob() {indices = indices, positions = positions, texCoords = texCoords, colors = colors, segments = segments, bounds = bds}; var jh = cj.Schedule(); return jh; } }"

    "title": "Fill Tessellation (C# Job) | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Fill Tessellation (C# Job) Example of a Sprite Shape: the blue area is the inner fill geometry, while the green area is the edge geometry. The geometry of a Sprite Shape is made up of its outer edge (for both Open and Closed Shapes and its inner fill (only for Closed Shapes). Both edge and fill geometry are always generated in a C# Job which provides performance benefits and avoids potential performance loss from garbage collection (refer to Understanding Automatic Memory Management for more information). Running C# Job also gains additional performance if the Burst package is installed in the same Project. If Fill Tessellation (C# Job) is disabled, the fill geometry is generated in the main thread using LibNess.NET instead (see What is multithreading? for more information). Requirements The Fill Tessellation (C# Job) option in the Sprite Shape Controller Inspector window To enable Fill Tessellation (C# Job), select a Sprite Shape and then select the Fill Tessellation (C# Job) checkbox in its Inspector window; clear the checkbox to disable the feature. The Sprite Shape must also fulfill the following requirements for this feature to work: The Sprite Shape must not have any duplicate points or points that are too close to each other. Duplicate points can occur if you drag a point over another point. The Sprite Shape’s edges cannot intersect or overlap each other. Note: If Fill Tessellation (C# Job) is enabled but the Sprite Shape does not fulfill these requirements, then the Sprite Shape’s Fill geometry will not be generated. Disable Fill Tessellation (C# Job) to enable the default tessellation method to generate the geometry. Enabling or disabling this option does not affect the edge geometry tessellation method which is always in a C# Job. Recommended tessellation method The following are examples and reasons for when either method of tessellation is recommended, depending on the requirements of your project. When Fill Tessellation (C# Job) is recommended Enabling Fill Tessellation (C# Job) is ideal for situations where you want to reduce memory usage for improved CPU performance. For example, when you have dynamic Sprite Shape objects generated at runtime, or are animating Sprite Shape objects at runtime. Both scenarios feature CPU intensive processes, and enabling Fill Tessellation (C# Job) helps to reduce the memory usage of these processes and improve performance overall. In general, enabling Fill Tessellation (C# Job) is also recommended whenever size and memory usage are important constraints to consider for your application or game. When default LibTess.NET is recommended It is recommended to disable the Fill Tessellation (C# Job) option and use the default LibTess.NET generation method whenever the Sprite Shape cannot meet the requirements that allow it to be generated in a C# Job. This could be because the Sprite Shape has a complex spline shape, with overlapping edges or duplicate points. If the Sprite Shape is being generated with non-deterministic and random input points for the shape of its spline, then it is recommended to use LibTess.NET as it is not guaranteed that the Sprite Shape fulfils the Fill Tessellation requirements. If you enabled Cache Geometry under the Sprite Shape Controller properties, then it is recommended that you use LibTess.NET instead of Fill Tessellation. The Sprite Shape’s geometry is cached as it is generated in the Editor, and this stored data is used at runtime instead of being generated at runtime. Both the LibTess.NET and Fill Tessellation options use this stored data instead of recalculating and regenerating the geometry if it is available. As LibTess.NET is more flexible and is able to accept a wider range of inputs when generating the Sprite Shape, it is recommended to disable Fill Tessellation if Cache Geometry is used."

See the Collider section of the Sprite Shape Controller page for more details about the various Sprite Shape Collider options. Manually editing the Collider mesh By default, the Collider mesh is automatically reshaped to match the Sprite Shape every time it is edited. To make manual edits to the Collider mesh directly, disable both Update Collider in the Sprite Shape Controller's Collider settings by clearing their respective checkboxes. This prevents the Sprite Shape Controller from updating the Collider mesh automatically and overriding your manual edits."

    "keywords": "Sprite Shape Controller The Sprite Shape Controller component is automatically attached to the GameObject created when a Sprite Shape Profile is dragged into the Scene. You edit the shape of the Sprite Shape's outline through the Controller's settings. The Controller displays different settings depending on different conditions. Property Settings - Default The default component settings below are displayed when Edit Spline is not enabled. Property Function Profile Select the Sprite Shape Profile used by this Sprite Shape. Edit Spline Enable to make the Control Points of the Sprite Shape visible and editable. Spline - Detail Select the tessellation quality of the rendered Sprite Shape mesh. High/Medium/Low Quality options available. Open Ended Disable to connect both ends of the Sprite Shape together to form an enclosed Shape. Enable to leave both ends of the Sprite Shape unconnected. Adaptive UV Enabled by default. When enabled, Unity attempts to seamlessly tile the Sprites along the Sprite Shape path by deforming the Sprites to between Control Points. Disable this property to tile Sprites with no deformation and at their exact width. Sprites may appear cutoff if the space between Control Points is shorter than the width of the Sprite. Enable Tangents Enable this property if there are features which require tangent calculations, such as when utilizing the Shaders with the 2D Universal Render Pipeline. Corner Threshold Use this slider to set the threshold of when a point is considered a corner of the Sprite Shape, where the value is the angle between adjacent edges and angles at the. A point is considered a corner at the threshold value and lower. The default value is 30 degrees. Set a custom value to override this default value. Fill - Fill Tessellation (C# Job) Generate fill geometry in C# Job. Stretch UV Enable this setting to have Unity stretch the UV of the Fill texture across the Full Rect of the Sprite Shape. Custom Geometry Creator Set the Scriptable Object that generates custom geometry. By default a built-in generator is set when created. Custom Geometry Modifier Set a list of Scriptable Objects that modifies generated geometry. Pixels Per Unit (only available when Stretch UV is disabled) This values affect the appearance of the Fill texture of the Sprite Shape. This value affects the scale of the Fill texture, with higher values reducing the size of the texture. The default value is 100. World Space UV (only available when Stretch UV is disabled) Enable to apply the Fill texture according to the World Space UV, instead of per GameObject UV. With Edit Spline enabled and a Control Point selected Enable Edit Spline in the Controller settings to make Control Points on the Sprite Shape visible and editable. Selecting a Control Point enables the following additional Controller settings. A: Global snap toggle Point - Tangent Mode Select one of three Point Modes to change the way tangents on Control Points are edited. Linear No curve is formed between the Control Point and its neighboring points. Continuous Mirrored Two tangents appear on opposite sides of the Control Point, and the spline between the Control Point and its neighbors becomes curved. Adjust the tangents to change the shape of the curve. The angle between the two tangents is always 180 degrees in this mode. Broken Mirrored Two tangents appear on opposite sides of the Control Point, and the spline between the Control Point and its neighbors becomes curved. Adjust the tangents to change the shape of the curve. The length and angle of the tangents can be adjusted independently in this mood. Position The local x and y coordinates of a selected Control Point. Height Increase or decrease the height of Sprites at the Control Point by a factor of 0.1 to 4. Corner Sets whether Corner Sprites are rendered at Control Points. Set to Automatic by default. Disabled A Sprite is not rendered at the selected Control Point. Automatic The Control Point displays the assigned Corner Sprite, if both it and its neighbors are in Linear Point Mode. Stretched The Corner Sprite at the selected Control Point is connected to its adjacent neighbors, stretching the Sprite. See the list of required criteria below to use this feature. Sprite Variant Select the Sprite Variant from the visual Variant selector. Press N to cycle through all available Variants for the Control Point. Global snapping When Edit Spline is enabled, select the Global Snap icon (see A in screenshot above) to toggle Grid Snapping on or off. Stretched Corners This feature allows the Sprite Shape to form corners with stretched Sprites between adjacent edges between the corner point and its neighbors. Select the Stretched option from the Corner dropdown menu, and ensure the following criteria are met: Both the selected and adjacent points have the same Height. Sprites rendered at the Corner point and its neighboring points must have the same Sprite pivot position. Additional Collider settings Add either the Polygon Collider 2D or Edge Collider 2D component to the Sprite Shape to enable additional Collider settings in the Sprite Shape Controller. Refer to Enabling Collision for more details about enabling Colliders with Sprite Shapes. Colliders are always optimized by cleaning up extra control points that are colinear. Collider - Update Collider Enabled by Default. Enable this option to have the Collider mesh be updated to the Sprite Shape's current shape as the Sprite Shape is edited. Disable if you are editing the Collider mesh separately from the Sprite Shape and to use a custom Collider mesh. Offset Select the amount to extrude the Collider mesh towards the edge of the Sprite Shape. The range is from -0.5 to 0.5, starting at 0 by default. Detail Sets the tessellation quality of the rendered Collider. High/Medium/Low Quality options available. Editing the Spline To edit the mesh outline of the Sprite Shape, click the Edit Spline button to make the Shape's spline and its Control Points become visible and editable. When Edit Spline is enabled, move the Control Points of the Sprite Shape to adjust its overall shape and size. Add additional Control Points by clicking on the spline in between Control Points. Press the Del/Delete key to remove the currently selected Control Point. With a Control Point selected, cycle through the __Point Modes __by pressing the M key. To change the Mode of multiple Control Points at once, ensure that all selected Control Points are the same Mode first before cycling or selecting another Mode. To change the Sprite Variant currently displayed at a selected Control Point, press the N key to cycle through all available Variants. All shortcut keys can be rebound under the Shortcut menu (menu: Edit > Shortcuts... > SpriteShape Editing). Point Modes When a Control Point is selected, its Point Mode can be one of three modes- Linear, Mirrored, and Non-Mirrored. The Point Mode determines the behavior of the tangents that are used to adjust the spline between Control Points. Each Control Point can be set to a specific Point Mode and contain its own settings. Linear Point Mode In Linear Point Mode, there are no tangents to control the curve between the Control Point and its neighbors, curves are not formed between Control Points and Sprites may overlap if they intersect. Adjust which Sprite is displayed when two or more intersect by adjusting their Order value in the Sprite Shape Profile's Angle Range settings. Continuous Mirrored Point Mode In Continuous Mirrored Point Mode, tangents appear on both sides of the selected Control Point to create a curve between the Control Point and its neighbors. Adjust the shape of the curve with the tangents. In this mode, the angle between the tangents is always maintained at 180 degrees although their lengths from the can vary. Press B to mirror the length of the last edited tangent onto the opposite tangent. Broken Mirrored Point Mode In Broken Mirrored Point Mode, tangents appear on both sides of the selected Control Point to create a curve between the Control Point and its neighbors. Adjust the shape of the curve with the tangents. In this mode, the length and angle of each tangent can be adjusted independently. Press B to mirror the length of the last edited tangent onto the opposite tangent. In this mode, pressing B also causes the angle of the opposite tangent to become exactly 180 degrees from the last edited tangent."

You can use the same Profile for multiple Sprite Shapes in a Scene. Create a Sprite Shape Profile from the Editor main menu (menu: Assets > Create > Sprite Shape Profile), and select from the two available options: Open Shape and Closed Shape. Property Function Control Points - Use Sprite Borders Enable to draw the Sprite Borders of a Sprite at the Control Point. Define the Sprite Borders in the Sprite Editor. Fill - Texture Set the Texture to be used as a Fill to this field. Has no effect if the Open Ended property in the Sprite Shape Controller settings is enabled. Offset Determines the border offset at the edges of the Fill texture. Angle Ranges (tool) Use this tool to create Angle Ranges and assign Sprites to those ranges. Start (degrees) Enter the starting angle for the selected Angle Range in degrees. End (degrees) Enter the ending angle for the selected Angle Range in degrees. Order Determines the display priority when Sprites intersect. Sprites with higher values are rendered above lower ones. Sprites List of Sprites assigned to the selected Angle Range. Displays a list of all Sprites assigned to the selected Angle Range. The order of Sprites in the list determines their Sprite Variant number, starting from zero at the top of the list. The first Sprite at the top of the list is the Sprite displayed by default at a Control Point. Corners - (All Corner options) Assign specific Sprites to be displayed on the Sprite Shape at the respective corners. Open Shape Use the Open Shape preset Profile to create Shapes made from a single edge outline with tiled Sprites along its edge. This preset is ideal for creating level elements such as platforms. Drag the Open Shape Profile into the Scene view to automatically generate a Sprite Shape with Open Ended enabled in its Sprite Shape Controller settings. Closed Shape Use the Closed Shape preset Profile to create Shapes that encompass an enclosed area. The Closed Sprite Shape can display and tile a Fill texture in the enclosed area, if a Fill texture is set in its Profile settings. Use this preset to create large solid filled Shapes that are ideal for backgrounds or large platforms. Drag the Closed Shape Profile into the Scene view to automatically generate a Sprite Shape with Open Ended disabled in its Sprite Shape Controller settings. The Closed Shape Profile's preset Angle Ranges create a square Sprite Shape by default. A key feature of the Sprite Shape Profile is the Angle Ranges tool. Assigning an Angle Range determines what Sprite is displayed at specific angles, as the Sprite Shape is deformed in the Scene. Creating Angle Ranges Method 1: To create an Angle Range, click the Create Range button at the bottom of the Angle Ranges tool: The Create Range button is only visible if the Preview Handle is over an area without an Angle Range (see the example image below). Method 2: Another way is to hover your cursor over an empty area of the Angle Range circle. An outline appears to show the possible default angle range. Click to create this Angle Range. Editing the Angle Range degrees The range covered by the currently selected Angle Range is displayed at the bottom of the tool. You can edit a range by entering new values into Start and End, or drag either endpoint of the tool to the desired angles. A range cannot be extended into an existing neighboring range. To delete an Angle Range, select the range and then press the Del/Delete key. Assigning Sprites After creating the Angle Ranges, the next step is to assign Sprites to those ranges. The Sprites list is found beneath the Angle Ranges tool. It lists all the Sprites assigned to the selected range. To add Sprites to the list, click the + icon to insert a new row to the list. Click the circle icon next to the empty row to open the Object Picker window, which displays all available Sprites in the project. You can also drag a Sprite directly onto a row to add it to the list. The Sprite at the top of the list is the default Sprite displayed on the Sprite Shape. Refer to the other Sprites in the list by their Sprite Variant number. See the Sprite Shape Controller page for more details. Drag the leftmost ends of the rows up or down to reorder the list, which changes the Sprite Variant numbers of the Sprites accordingly. Previewing Sprites of multiple Angle Ranges After assigning Sprites to multiple Angle Ranges, rotate the Preview Handle around the Angle Range tool to preview the Sprites assigned those ranges."

    "keywords": "2D Sprite Shape Overview The Sprite Shape is a flexible and powerful world building Asset that features Sprite tiling along a shape's outline that automatically deforms and swaps Sprites based on the angle of the outline. Additionally, you can assign a Fill texture to a Sprite Shape to create filled shapes with tiled textures as backgrounds or other large level-building props. The following are examples of Sprite Shapes used to construct different parts of various levels. Sprite Shapes comprise of two parts - the Sprite Shape Profile Asset, and the Sprite Shape Controller component. The Sprite Shape Profile contains the angle settings and Sprites used by the Sprite Shape, and you edit the Sprite Shape's outline with the Sprite Shape Controller component. Importing Sprites for Sprite Shapes When importing Sprites, use the following property settings to ensure that the Sprites are compatible for use with Sprite Shape: Texture Type - Set this to ‘Sprite (2D and UI)’. Other Texture types are not supported for Sprite Shapes. Sprite Mode - Set this to ‘Single’ if the Texture contains only a single Sprite. Mesh Type - This must be set to Full Rect for the Sprite to be used with Sprite Shape. In addition, if the Sprites used for the Sprite Shape are part of a Sprite Atlas, disable both Allow Rotation and Tight Packing options under the Sprite Atlas’ properties so that the Sprites can be used by the Sprite Shape. Creating a Sprite Shape general workflow Create Sprite Shapes with the following steps: Create a Sprite Shape GameObject from the main GameObject menu (menu: GameObject > 2D Object > Sprite Shape) and select from the two available options: Open Shape Closed Shape Edit the outline of the Sprite Shape with the Sprite Shape Controller component settings. Enable Physics 2D interactions for your Sprite Shapes by attaching a Collider component. To further customize the shape and outline of a Sprite Shape: Create a Sprite Shape Profile from the main menu (menu: Assets > Create > 2D > Sprite Shape Profile). Create Angle Ranges and assign Sprites in the Sprite Shape Profile. Assign the Sprite Shape Profile to a Sprite Shape Controller's Profile settings. The same Profile can be used by multiple Sprite Shapes."

This allows you to create Tiles that provide specialized behavior in specific scenarios. Properties Property Function Tile The Rule Tile to override. Depending on the Rule Tile that is overridden, there may be further properties which you can override here. Any public property in the Rule Tile that does not have a RuleTile.DontOverride attribute will be shown here and can be overridden. Usage First select the Rule Tile to be overridden in the Tile property. The Rule Override Tile editor then displays the different rules in the selected Rule Tile which you can override. Select the Rule which you want to override by toggling the Rule. This will allow you to modify the output of the Rule, such as the Sprite, the GameObject or the Collider Type. The outputs are the same as the original Rule Tile and are detailed there. The matching Rule itself cannot be changed here and is displayed here to help identify it. Paint with the Advanced Rule Override Tile using the Tile Palette tools."

    "keywords": "Rule Tile Contributions by: johnsoncodehk, DreadBoy, AVChemodanov, DoctorShinobi, n4n0lix This is a generic visual Tile that other Tiles such as the Terrain Tiles, Pipeline Tile, Random Tile or Animated Tiles are based on. There are specific types of Rule Tiles for each of the Tilemap grid types. The default Rule Tile is for the default Rectangle Grid type; the Hexagonal Rule Tile is for the Hexagonal Grid type; and the Isometric Rule Tile is for the Isometric Grid types. The different types of Rule Tiles all possess the same properties. Properties The Rule Tile editor of a Terrain Tile. Property Function Default Sprite The default Sprite set when creating a new Rule. Default GameObject The default GameObject set when creating a new Rule. Default Collider The default Collider Type set when creating a new Rule. Tiling Rules Tiling Rules properties Property Function Rule The Rule Type for this Rule. GameObject The GameObject for the Tile which fits this Rule. Collider The Collider Type for the Tile which fits this Rule Output The Output for the Tile which fits this Rule. Each Output type has its own properties. Output: Fixed Property Function Sprite Display this Sprite for Tiles which fit this Rule. Output: Random Property Function Noise The Perlin noise factor when placing the Tile. Shuffle The randomized transform given to the Tile when placing it. Size The number of Sprites to randomize from. Sprite The Sprite for the Tile which fits this Rule. A random Sprite will be chosen out of this when placing the Tile. Output: Animation Property Function MinSpeed The minimum speed at which the animation is played. MaxSpeed The maximum speed at which the animation is played. Size The number of Sprites in the animation. Sprite The Sprite for the Tile which fits this Rule. Sprites will be shown in sequence based on the order of the list. Editor Properties Property Function Extend Neighbor Enabling this allows you to increase the range of neighbors beyond the 3x3 box. Setting up a Rule Tile Set up the Rule Tile with the required rules with the Rule Tile editor. In the Rule Tile editor, you can change, add, duplicate or remove Rules in the Tiling Rules list. Click on the + or - buttons to add or remove Rules. If you have a Rule selected, clicking on the + button will allow you to choose between adding a new Rule or duplicating the selected Rule. The newly created Rule will be placed after the current selected Rule. Select and hold the top left corner of each row to drag them up or down to change the order of the Rules in the list. Rule Tile Editor When you add a new Rule, the Rule editor displays the following: the list of Rule properties, a 3x3 box that visualizes the behavior of the set Rules, and a Sprite selector that displays a preview of the selected Sprite. The 3x3 box represents the neighbors a Tile can have, where the center represents the Tile itself, and the eight bordering cells are its neighboring Tiles in their relative positions to the Tile. Each of the neighboring cells can be set with one of three options: Don't Care, This and Not This. These define the behavior of the Rule Tile towards these Tiles. Edit the 3x3 box to set up the Rule the Tile must match. Options Rule Tile behavior Don't Care The Rule Tile ignores the contents in this cell. This The Rule Tile checks if the contents of this cell is an instance of this Rule Tile. If it is an instance, the rule passes. If it is not an instance, the rule fails. Not This The Rule Tile checks if the contents of this cell is not an instance of this Rule Tile. If it is not an instance, the rule passes. If it is an instance, the rule fails. If all of the neighbors of the Rule Tile match the options set for their respective directions, then the Rule is considered matched and the rest of the Rule properties are applied. When the Rule is set to Fixed, the Rule will only match exactly the conditions set for its neighbors. The example below will only match if there are the same Rule Tiles to the left and right of it. When the Rule is set to ‘Rotated’, the 3x3 box will be rotated 90 degrees each time the Rule fails to match and it will try to match again with this rotated 3x3 box. If the Rule now matches, the contents of this Rule will be applied as well as the rotation required to match the Rule. Use this if you want the Rule to match for the four 90 degree rotations if rotation is possible. When the Rule is set to Mirror X, Mirror Y or Mirror XY, the 3x3 box will be mirrored in that axis each time the Rule fails to match and it will try to match again with this mirrored 3x3 box. If the Rule now matches, the contents of this Rule will be applied as well as the mirroring required to match the Rule. Use this if you want the Rule to match for the mirrored locations if mirroring is possible. If you want the Rule Tile to have a Random output, you can set the Output to Random. This will allow you to specify a number of input Sprites to randomize from. The rotation of the Sprites can be randomized as well by changing the Shuffle property. If you want the Rule Tile to output a Sprite Animation, you can set the Output to Animation. This will allow you to specify a number of Sprites to animate sequentially. The speed of the Animation can be randomized as well by changing the Speed property. When Extend Neighbors is enabled, the 3x3 box can be extended to allow for more specific neighbor matching. The Transform rule matching (eg. Rotated, Mirror) will apply for the extended neighbors set. Paint with the Rule Tile in the same way as other Tiles by using the Tile Palette tools. For optimization, please set the most common Rule at the top of the list of Rules and follow with next most common Rule and so on. When matching Rules during the placement of the Tile, the Rule Tile algorithm will check the first Rule first, before proceeding with the next Rules."

The Drop Plank scene included in the package samples now has a NavMeshSurface component and the NavMeshSurfaceUpdater script on the geometry, as well as the DynamicNavMeshObject script on the Plank prefab for dynamically updating the NavMesh when new Planks are instantiated. The offset when instantiating Planks in the Drop Plank scene has been reduced. The Sliding Window Infinite and the Sliding Window Terrain scenes included in the package samples now use the NavMeshSurfaceVolumeUpdater script instead of the LocalNavMeshBuilder and NavMeshSourceTag scripts for dynamically updating the NavMesh. The Modify Mesh scene included in the package samples now uses a NavMeshSurface component on the Mesh Tool for dynamically updating the NavMesh instead of the LocalNavMeshBuilder and NavMeshSourceTag scripts. The MeshTool script now uses the Update() method of NavMeshSurface for updating the NavMesh whenever the mesh is modified. Fixed The Drop Plank scene included in the package samples now destroys instantiated Planks that have fallen off the edge. Missing agent type references in the samples. Removed The NavMeshPrefabInstance and NavMeshPrefabInstanceEditor scripts from the package samples were removed. The prefab editing scene 7b_dungeon_tile_prefabs from the package samples was removed. The tiles can now be edited directly as prefabs. The LocalNavMeshBuilder and NavMeshSourceTag scripts from the package samples were removed. [1.1.0-pre.1] - 2022-04-27 Added NavMeshSurface supports links generation. NavMeshSurface supports HeightMesh baking. New package Navigation window adapting the obsolete Unity Navigation window functionalities to the package workflow. Changed NavMeshSurface is using the Background Tasks window to report the baking progress Minimum supported version is increased to Unity 2022.2 [1.0.0-exp.4] - 2021-07-19 Changed Documentation updated with changes from Unity manual Test scripts moved into namespaces Unity.AI.Navigation.Tests and Unity.AI.Navigation.Editor.Tests [1.0.0-exp.3] - 2021-06-16 Fixed An assembly definition in the package sample was referencing an invalid AsmDef [1.0.0-exp.2] - 2021-05-19 Fixed Baking a NavMeshSurface with a bounding volume was not detecting the geometry nearby the bounds (1027006) Changed New note in the documentation about the bounding volume of a NavMeshSurface [1.0.0-exp.1] - 2021-04-06 This is the first release of the AI Navigation package. It contains the scripts that were previously known as NavMeshComponents and it adds a few improvements. Fixed Disabling a NavMeshLink component in the Editor does not remove the link Added New minRegionArea property in NavMeshSurface that prevents small isolated patches from being built in the NavMesh Documentation for the new minRegionArea property Changed Documentation updated Script namespaces changed to Unity.AI.Navigation.* The license has changed.

    "keywords": "About NavMesh agents The NavMesh agent is a GameObject that is represented by an upright cylinder whose size is specified by the Radius and Height properties. The cylinder moves with the GameObject, but remains upright even if the GameObject rotates. The shape of the cylinder is used to detect and respond to collisions with other agents and obstacles. When the anchor point of the GameObject is not at the base of the cylinder, use the Base Offset property to specify the height difference. The height and radius of the cylinder are specified in the Navigation window and the NavMesh Agent component properties of the individual agents. Navigation window settings describe how all the NavMesh Agents collide and avoid static world geometry. To keep memory on budget and CPU load at a reasonable level, you can only specify one size in the bake settings. NavMesh Agent component properties values describe how the agent collides with moving obstacles and other agents. Typically you set the size of the agent with the same values in both places. However, you might, give a heavy soldier a larger radius, so that other agents leave more space around your soldier. Otherwise, your soldier avoids the environment in the same manner as the other agents. Additional resources Create a NavMesh Agent NavMesh Agent component reference NavMesh Agent scripting reference"

    "keywords": "HeightMesh The HeightMesh allows for the character to be placed more accurately on the ground. While navigating, the NavMesh Agent is constrained on the surface of the NavMesh. Since the NavMesh is an approximation of the walkable space, some features are evened out when the NavMesh is being built. For example, stairs may appear as a slope in the NavMesh. Without the HeightMesh the characters are moved along the approximate NavMesh surface. If your game requires accurate placement of the agent, you should enable the HeightMesh option when you build the NavMesh. Note that building the HeightMesh will take up memory and processing at runtime, and it will lengthen the total time of baking the NavMesh."

    "title": "About NavMesh Obstacles | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "About NavMesh Obstacles NavMesh Obstacles can affect the NavMesh Agent’s navigation during the game in two ways: Obstructing When Carve is not enabled, the default behavior of the NavMesh Obstacle is similar to that of a [Collider][2]. NavMesh Agents try to avoid [collisions][3] with the NavMesh Obstacle, and when close, they collide with the NavMesh Obstacle. Obstacle avoidance behaviour is very basic, and has a short radius. As such, the NavMesh Agent might not be able to find its way around in an environment cluttered with NavMesh Obstacles. This mode is best used in cases where the obstacle is constantly moving (for example, a vehicle or player character). Carving When Carve is enabled, the obstacle carves a hole in the NavMesh when stationary. When moving, the obstacle is an obstruction. When a hole is carved into the NavMesh, the pathfinder is able to navigate the NavMesh Agent around locations cluttered with obstacles, or find another route if the current path gets blocked by an obstacle. It’s good practice to turn on carving for NavMesh Obstacles that generally block navigation but can be moved by the player or other game events like explosions (for example, crates or barrels). Logic for moving NavMesh Obstacles Unity treats the NavMesh Obstacle as moving when it has moved more than the distance set by the Carve > Move Threshold. When the NavMesh Obstacle moves, the carved hole also moves. However, to reduce CPU overhead, the hole is only recalculated when necessary. The result of this calculation is available in the next frame update. The recalculation logic has two options: Only carve when the NavMesh Obstacle is stationary Carve when the NavMesh Obstacle has moved Only carve when the NavMesh Obstacle is stationary This is the default behavior. To enable it, tick the NavMesh Obstacle component’s Carve Only Stationary checkbox. In this mode, when the NavMesh Obstacle moves, the carved hole is removed. When the NavMesh Obstacle has stopped moving and has been stationary for more than the time set by Carving Time To Stationary, it is treated as stationary and the carved hole is updated again. While the NavMesh Obstacle is moving, the NavMesh Agents avoid it using collision avoidance, but don’t plan paths around it. Carve Only Stationary is generally the best choice in terms of performance, and is a good match when the [GameObject][4] associated with the NavMesh Obstacle is controlled by physics. Carve when the NavMesh Obstacle has moved To enable this mode, untick the NavMesh Obstacle component’s Carve Only Stationary checkbox. When this is unticked, the carved hole is updated when the obstacle has moved more than the distance set by Carving Move Threshold. This mode is useful for large, slowly moving obstacles (for example, a tank that is being avoided by infantry). Note: When using NavMesh query methods, you should take into account that there is a one-frame delay between changing a NavMesh Obstacle and the effect that change has on the NavMesh.

In addition each NavMesh Agent has an Area Mask which can be used to specify on which areas the agent can move. In the above example the area types are used for two common use cases: Water area is made more costly to walk by assigning it a higher cost, to deal with a scenario where walking on shallow water is slower. Door area is made accessible by specific characters, to create a scenario where humans can walk through doors, but zombies cannot. The area type can be assigned to every object that is included in the NavMesh baking, in addition, each Off-Mesh Link has a property to specify the area type. Pathfinding Cost In a nutshell, the cost allows you to control which areas the pathfinder favors when finding a path. For example, if you set the cost of an area to 3.0, traveling across that area is considered to be three times longer than alternative routes. To fully understand how the cost works, let’s take a look at how the pathfinder works. Nodes and links visited during pathfinding. Unity uses A* to calculate the shortest path on the NavMesh. A* works on a graph of connected nodes. The algorithm starts from the nearest node to the path start and visits the connect nodes until the destination is reached. Since the Unity navigation representation is a mesh of polygons, the first thing the pathfinder needs to do is to place a point on each polygon, which is the location of the node. The shortest path is then calculated between these nodes. The yellow dots and lines in the above picture shows how the nodes and links are placed on the NavMesh, and in which order they are traversed during the A*. The cost to move between two nodes depends on the distance to travel and the cost associated with the area type of the polygon under the link, that is, distance * cost. In practice this means, that if the cost of an area is 2.0, the distance across such polygon will appear to be twice as long. The A* algorithm requires that all costs must be larger than 1.0. The effect of the costs on the resulting path can be hard to tune, especially for longer paths. The best way to approach costs is to treat them as hints. For example, if you want the agents to not to use Off-Mesh Links too often, you could increase their cost. But it can be challenging to tune a behavior where the agents to prefer to walk on sidewalks. Another thing you may notice on some levels is that the pathfinder does not always choose the very shortest path. The reason for this is the node placement. The effect can be noticeable in scenarios where big open areas are next to tiny obstacles, which results navigation mesh with very big and small polygons. In such cases the nodes on the big polygons may get placed anywhere in the big polygon and from the pathfinder’s point of view it looks like a detour. The cost per area type can be set globally in the Areas tab, or you can override them per agent using a script. Area Types The area types are specified in the Navigation Window’s Areas tab. There are 29 custom types, and 3 built-in types: Walkable, Not Walkable, and Jump. Walkable is a generic area type which specifies that the area can be walked on. Not Walkable is a generic area type which prevents navigation. It is useful for cases where you want to mark certain object to be an obstacle, but without getting NavMesh on top of it. Jump is an area type that is assigned to all auto-generated Off-Mesh Links. If several objects of different area types are overlapping, the resulting navmesh area type will generally be the one with the highest index. There is one exception however: Not Walkable always takes precedence. Which can be helpful if you need to block out an area. Area Mask Each agent has an Area Mask which describes which areas it can use when navigating. The area mask can be set in the agent properties, or the bitmask can be manipulated using a script at runtime. The area mask is useful when you want only certain types characters to be able to walk through an area. For example, in a zombie evasion game, you could mark the area under each door with a Door area type, and uncheck the Door area from the zombie character’s Area Mask.

    "keywords": "Coupling Animation and Navigation The goal of this document is to guide you to setup navigating humanoid characters to move using the navigation system. We’ll be using Unity’s built-in systems for animation and navigation along with custom scripting to achieve this. It’s assumed you’re familiar with the basics of Unity and the Mecanim animation system. An example project is available — so you don’t have add scripts or set up animations and animation controller from scratch: NavigationAnimation_53.zip Works with Unity 5.3+ Creating the Animation Controller To get a responsive and versatile animation controller — covering a wide range of movements — we need a set of animations moving in different directions. This is sometimes referred to as a strafe-set. In addition to the move animations we need an animation for the standing character. We proceed by arranging the strafe-set in a 2D blend tree — choose blend type: 2D Simple Directional and place animations using Compute Positions > Velocity XZ For blending control we add two float parameters velx and vely, and assign them to the blend tree. Here we’ll be placing 7 run animations — each with a different velocity. In addition to the forwards (+ left/right) and backwards (+ left/right) we also use an animation clip for running on the spot. The latter is highlighted in the center of the 2D blend map below. The reason for having an animation running on the spot is two-fold, firstly it preserves the style of running when blended with the other animations. Secondly the animation prevents foot-sliding when blending. Then we add the idle animation clip in it’s own node (Idle). We now have two discrete animation states that we couple with 2 transitions. To control the switch between the moving and idle states we add a boolean control parameter move. Then disable the Has Exit Time property on the transitions. This allows the transition to trigger at any time during the animation. Transition time should be set to around 0.10 second to get a responsive transition. Now place the new created animation controller on the character you want to move. Press play and select the character in the Hierarchy window. You can now manually control the animation values in the Animator window and change the move state and velocity. The next step is to create other means of controlling the animation parameters. Navigation Control Place a NavMeshAgent component on the character and adjust the radius, height and to match the character - additionally change the speed property to match the maximum speed in the animation blend tree. Create a NavMesh for the Scene you’ve placed the character in. Next we need to tell the character where to navigate to. This typically is very specific to the application. Here we choose a click to move behavior — the character moved to the point in the world where the user has clicked on the screen. // ClickToMove.cs using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.AI; [RequireComponent (typeof (NavMeshAgent))] public class ClickToMove : MonoBehaviour { RaycastHit hitInfo = new RaycastHit(); NavMeshAgent agent; void Start () { agent = GetComponent<NavMeshAgent> (); } void Update () { if(Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) { Ray ray = Camera.main.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition); if (Physics.Raycast(ray.origin, ray.direction, out hitInfo)) agent.destination = hitInfo.point; } } } Pressing play now — and clicking around in the scene — you’ll see the character move around in the scene. However — the animations don’t match the movement at all. We need to communicate the state and velocity of the agent to the animation controller. To transfer the velocity and state info from the agent to the animation controller we will add another script. // LocomotionSimpleAgent.cs using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.AI; [RequireComponent (typeof (NavMeshAgent))] [RequireComponent (typeof (Animator))] public class LocomotionSimpleAgent : MonoBehaviour { Animator anim; NavMeshAgent agent; Vector2 smoothDeltaPosition = Vector2.zero; Vector2 velocity = Vector2.zero; void Start () { anim = GetComponent<Animator> (); agent = GetComponent<NavMeshAgent> (); // Don’t update position automatically agent.updatePosition = false; } void Update () { Vector3 worldDeltaPosition = agent.nextPosition - transform.position; // Map 'worldDeltaPosition' to local space float dx = Vector3.Dot (transform.right, worldDeltaPosition); float dy = Vector3.Dot (transform.forward, worldDeltaPosition); Vector2 deltaPosition = new Vector2 (dx, dy); // Low-pass filter the deltaMove float smooth = Mathf.Min(1.0f, Time.deltaTime/0.15f); smoothDeltaPosition = Vector2.Lerp (smoothDeltaPosition, deltaPosition, smooth); // Update velocity if time advances if (Time.deltaTime > 1e-5f) velocity = smoothDeltaPosition / Time.deltaTime; bool shouldMove = velocity.magnitude > 0.5f && agent.remainingDistance > agent.radius; // Update animation parameters anim.SetBool(\"move\", shouldMove); anim.SetFloat (\"velx\", velocity.x); anim.SetFloat (\"vely\", velocity.y); GetComponent<LookAt>().lookAtTargetPosition = agent.steeringTarget + transform.forward; } void OnAnimatorMove () { // Update position to agent position transform.position = agent.nextPosition; } } This script deserves a little explanation. It’s placed on the character — which has an Animator and a NavMeshAgent component attached — as well as the click to move script above. First the script tells the agent not to update the character position automatically. We handle the position update that last in the script. The orientation is updated by the agent. The animation blend is controlled by reading the agent velocity. It is transformed into a relative velocity (based on character orientation) — and then smoothed. The transformed horizontal velocity components are then passed to the Animator and additionally the state switching between idle and moving is controlled by the speed (i.e. velocity magnitude). In the OnAnimatorMove() callback we update the position of the character to match the NavMeshAgent. Playing the scene again gives show that animation matches the movement to as close as possible. Improving the Quality of the Navigating Character To improve the quality of the animated and navigating character we will explore a couple of options. Looking Having the character to look and turn towards points of interest is important to convey attention and anticipation. We’ll use the animation systems lookat API. This calls for another script. // LookAt.cs using UnityEngine; using System.Collections; [RequireComponent (typeof (Animator))] public class LookAt : MonoBehaviour { public Transform head = null; public Vector3 lookAtTargetPosition; public float lookAtCoolTime = 0.2f; public float lookAtHeatTime = 0.2f; public bool looking = true; private Vector3 lookAtPosition; private Animator animator; private float lookAtWeight = 0.0f; void Start () { if (!head) { Debug.LogError(\"No head transform - LookAt disabled\"); enabled = false; return; } animator = GetComponent<Animator> (); lookAtTargetPosition = head.position + transform.forward; lookAtPosition = lookAtTargetPosition; } void OnAnimatorIK () { lookAtTargetPosition.y = head.position.y; float lookAtTargetWeight = looking ? 1.0f : 0.0f; Vector3 curDir = lookAtPosition - head.position; Vector3 futDir = lookAtTargetPosition - head.position; curDir = Vector3.RotateTowards(curDir, futDir, 6.28f*Time.deltaTime, float.PositiveInfinity); lookAtPosition = head.position + curDir; float blendTime = lookAtTargetWeight > lookAtWeight ? lookAtHeatTime : lookAtCoolTime; lookAtWeight = Mathf.MoveTowards (lookAtWeight, lookAtTargetWeight, Time.deltaTime/blendTime); animator.SetLookAtWeight (lookAtWeight, 0.2f, 0.5f, 0.7f, 0.5f); animator.SetLookAtPosition (lookAtPosition); } } Add the script to the character and assign the head property to the head transform in your characters transform hierarchy. The LookAt script has no notion of navigation control — so to control where to look we go back to the LocomotionSimpleAgent.cs script and add a couple of lines to control the looking. Add the end of Update() add: LookAt lookAt = GetComponent<LookAt> (); if (lookAt) lookAt.lookAtTargetPosition = agent.steeringTarget + transform.forward; This will tell the LookAt script to set the point of interest to approximately the next corner along the path or — if no corners — to the end of the path. Try it out. Animation Driven Character using Navigation The character has so far been controlled completely by the position dictated by the agent. This ensures that the avoidance of other characters and obstacles translates directly to the character position. However it may lead to foot-sliding if the animation doesn’t cover the proposed velocity. Here we’ll relax the constraint of the character a bit. Basically we’ll be trading the avoidance quality for animation quality. Replace the OnAnimatorMove() callback on the LocomotionSimpleAgent.cs script replace the line with the following void OnAnimatorMove () { // Update position based on animation movement using navigation surface height Vector3 position = anim.rootPosition; position.y = agent.nextPosition.y; transform.position = position; } When trying this out you may notice the that character can now drift away from the agent position (green wireframe cylinder) . You may need to limit that character animation drift. This can be done either by pulling the agent towards the character — or pull the character towards the agent position. Add the following at the end of the Update() method on the script LocomotionSimpleAgent.cs. // Pull character towards agent if (worldDeltaPosition.magnitude > agent.radius) transform.position = agent.nextPosition - 0.9f*worldDeltaPosition; Or — if you want the agent to follow the character. // Pull agent towards character if (worldDeltaPosition.magnitude > agent.radius) agent.nextPosition = transform.position + 0.9f*worldDeltaPosition; What works best very much depends on the specific use-case. Conclusion We have set up a character that moves using the navigation system and animates accordingly. Tweaking the numbers of blend time, look-at weights etc. can improve the looks — and is a good way to further explore this setup."

We’re going to build our prototype agent from a cylinder and set it in motion. This is done using a NavMesh Agent component and a simple script. First let’s create the character: Create a cylinder: GameObject > 3D Object > Cylinder. The default cylinder dimensions (height 2 and radius 0.5) are good for a humanoid shaped agent, so we will leave them as they are. Add a NavMesh Agent component: Component > Navigation > NavMesh Agent. Now you have simple NavMesh Agent set up ready to receive commands! When you start to experiment with a NavMesh Agent, you most likely are going to adjust its dimensions for your character size and speed. The NavMesh Agent component handles both the pathfinding and the movement control of a character. In your scripts, navigation can be as simple as setting the desired destination point - the NavMesh Agent can handle everything from there on. // MoveTo.cs using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.AI; public class MoveTo : MonoBehaviour { public Transform goal; void Start () { NavMeshAgent agent = GetComponent<NavMeshAgent>(); agent.destination = goal.position; } } Next we need to build a simple script which allows you to send your character to the destination specified by another Game Object, and a Sphere which will be the destination to move to: Create a new C# script (MoveTo.cs) and replace its contents with the above script. Assign the MoveTo script to the character you’ve just created. Create a sphere, this will be the destination the agent will move to. Move the sphere away from the character to a location that is close to the NavMesh surface. Select the character, locate the MoveTo script, and assign the Sphere to the Goal property. Press Play; you should see the agent navigating to the location of the sphere. To sum it up, in your script, you will need to get a reference to the NavMesh Agent component and then to set the agent in motion, you just need to assign a position to its destination property.

For example, jumping over a ditch or a fence, or opening a door before walking through it, can be all described as Off-mesh links. We’re going to add an Off-Mesh Link component to describe a jump from the upper platform to the ground. First create two cylinders: Game Object > 3D Object > cylinder. You can scale the cylinders to (0.1, 0.5, 0.1) to make it easier to work with them. Move the first cylinder at the edge of the top platform, close to the NavMesh surface. Place the second cylinder on the ground, close to the NavMesh, at the location where the link should land. Select the first cylinder cylinder and add an Off-Mesh Link component to it. Choose Add Component from the inspector and choose Navigation > OffMesh Link. Assign the first cylinder in the Start field and the second cylinder in the End field. Now you have a functioning Off-Mesh Link set up! If the path via the off-mesh link is shorter than via walking along the Navmesh, the off-mesh link will be used. You can use any game object in the Scene to hold the Off-Mesh link component, for example a fence prefab could contain the off-mesh link component. Similarly you can use any game object with a Transform as the start and end marker. The NavMesh bake process can detect and create common jump-across and drop-down links automatically. Take a look at the Building Off-Mesh Links Automatically for more details. Details If the agent does not traverse an OffMesh link make sure that both end points are connected correctly. A properly connected end point should show a circle around the access point. Another common cause is that the Navmesh Agent’s Area Mask does not have the OffMesh Link’s area included.

Here the static world is the baked NavMesh. If you want a NavMesh Agent to push around physics objects or use physics triggers: Add a Collider component (if not present) Add Rigidbody component Turn on kinematic (Is Kinematic) - this is important! Kinematic means that the rigid body is controlled by something else than the physics simulation If both NavMesh Agent and Rigidbody (non-kinematic) are active at the same time, you have race condition Both components may try to move the agent at the same which leads to undefined behavior You can use a NavMesh Agent to move e.g. a player character, without physics Set players agent’s avoidance priority to a small number (high priority), to allow the player to brush through crowds Move the player agent using NavMeshAgent.velocity, so that other agents can predict the player movement to avoid the player. NavMesh Agent and Animator NavMesh Agent and Animator with Root Motion can cause race condition Both components try to move the transform each frame Two possible solutions Information should always flow in one direction Either agent moves the character and animations follows Or animation moves the character based on simulated result Otherwise you’ll end up having a hard to debug feedback loop Animation follows agent Use the NavMeshAgent.velocity as input to the Animator to roughly match the agent’s movement to the animations Robust and simple to implement, will result in foot sliding where animations cannot match the velocity Agent follows animation Disable NavMeshAgent.updatePosition and NavMeshAgent.updateRotation to detach the simulation from the game objects locations Use the difference between the simulated agent’s position (NavMeshAgent.nextPosition) and animation root (Animator.rootPosition) to calculate controls for the animations See Coupling Animation and Navigation for more details NavMesh Agent and NavMesh Obstacle Do not mix well!

    "keywords": "Making an Agent Patrol Between a Set of Points Many games feature NPCs that patrol automatically around the playing area. The navigation system can be used to implement this behaviour but it is slightly more involved than standard pathfinding - merely using the shortest path between two points makes for a limited and predictable patrol route. You can get a more convincing patrol pattern by keeping a set of key points that are “useful” for the NPC to pass through and visiting them in some kind of sequence. For example, in a maze, you might place the key patrol points at junctions and corners to ensure the agent checks every corridor. For an office building, the key points might be the individual offices and other rooms. A maze with key patrol points marked The ideal sequence of patrol points will depend on the way you want the NPCs to behave. For example, a robot would probably just visit the points in a methodical order while a human guard might try to catch the player out by using a more random pattern. The simple behaviour of the robot can be implemented using the code shown below. The patrol points are supplied to the script using a public array of Transforms. This array can be assigned from the inspector using GameObjects to mark the points’ positions. The GotoNextPoint function sets the destination point for the agent (which also starts it moving) and then selects the new destination that will be used on the next call. As it stands, the code cycles through the points in the sequence they occur in the array but you can easily modify this, say by using Random.Range to choose an array index at random. In the Update function, the script checks how close the agent is to the destination using the remainingDistance property. When this distance is very small, a call to GotoNextPoint is made to start the next leg of the patrol. // Patrol.cs using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.AI; using System.Collections; public class Patrol : MonoBehaviour { public Transform[] points; private int destPoint = 0; private NavMeshAgent agent; void Start () { agent = GetComponent<NavMeshAgent>(); // Disabling auto-braking allows for continuous movement // between points (ie, the agent doesn't slow down as it // approaches a destination point). agent.autoBraking = false; GotoNextPoint(); } void GotoNextPoint() { // Returns if no points have been set up if (points.Length == 0) return; // Set the agent to go to the currently selected destination. agent.destination = points[destPoint].position; // Choose the next point in the array as the destination, // cycling to the start if necessary. destPoint = (destPoint + 1) % points.Length; } void Update () { // Choose the next destination point when the agent gets // close to the current one. if (!agent.pathPending && agent.remainingDistance < 0.5f) GotoNextPoint(); } }"

    "title": "Inner Workings of the Navigation System | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Inner Workings of the Navigation System When you want to intelligently move characters in your game (or agents as they are called in AI circles), you have to solve two problems: how to reason about the level to find the destination, then how to move there. These two problems are tightly coupled, but quite different in nature. The problem of reasoning about the level is more global and static, in that it takes into account the whole scene. Moving to the destination is more local and dynamic, it only considers the direction to move and how to prevent collisions with other moving agents. Walkable Areas The navigation system needs its own data to represent the walkable areas in a game scene. The walkable areas define the places in the scene where the agent can stand and move. In Unity the agents are described as cylinders. The walkable area is built automatically from the geometry in the scene by testing the locations where the agent can stand. Then the locations are connected to a surface laying on top of the scene geometry. This surface is called the navigation mesh (NavMesh for short). The NavMesh stores this surface as convex polygons. Convex polygons are a useful representation, since we know that there are no obstructions between any two points inside a polygon. In addition to the polygon boundaries, we store information about which polygons are neighbours to each other. This allows us to reason about the whole walkable area. Finding Paths To find path between two locations in the scene, we first need to map the start and destination locations to their nearest polygons. Then we start searching from the start location, visiting all the neighbours until we reach the destination polygon. Tracing the visited polygons allows us to find the sequence of polygons which will lead from the start to the destination. A common algorithm to find the path is A* (pronounced “A star”), which is what Unity uses. Following the Path The sequence of polygons which describe the path from the start to the destination polygon is called a corridor. The agent will reach the destination by always steering towards the next visible corner of the corridor. If you have a simple game where only one agent moves in the scene, it is fine to find all the corners of the corridor in one swoop and animate the character to move along the line segments connecting the corners. When dealing with multiple agents moving at the same time, they will need to deviate from the original path when avoiding each other. Trying to correct such deviations using a path consisting of line segments soon becomes very difficult and error prone. Since the agent movement in each frame is quite small, we can use the connectivity of the polygons to fix up the corridor in case we need to take a little detour. Then we quickly find the next visible corner to steer towards. Avoiding Obstacles The steering logic takes the position of the next corner and based on that figures out a desired direction and speed (or velocity) needed to reach the destination. Using the desired velocity to move the agent can lead to collision with other agents. Obstacle avoidance chooses a new velocity which balances between moving in the desired direction and preventing future collisions with other agents and edges of the navigation mesh. Unity is using reciprocal velocity obstacles (RVO) to predict and prevent collisions. Moving the Agent Finally after steering and obstacle avoidance the final velocity is calculated. In Unity the agents are simulated using a simple dynamic model, which also takes into account acceleration to allow more natural and smooth movement. At this stage you can feed the velocity from the simulated agent to the animation system to move the character using root motion, or let the navigation system take care of that. Once the agent has been moved using either method, the simulated agent location is moved and constrained to NavMesh. This last small step is important for robust navigation. Global and Local One of the most important things to understand about navigation is the difference between global and local navigation. Global navigation is used to find the corridor across the world. Finding a path across the world is a costly operation requiring quite a lot of processing power and memory. The linear list of polygons describing the path is a flexible data structure for steering, and it can be locally adjusted as the agent’s position moves. Local navigation tries to figure out how to efficiently move towards the next corner without colliding with other agents or moving objects. Two Cases for Obstacles Many applications of navigation require other types of obstacles rather than just other agents. These could be the usual crates and barrels in a shooter game, or vehicles. The obstacles can be handled using local obstacle avoidance or global pathfinding. When an obstacle is moving, it is best handled using local obstacles avoidance. This way the agent can predictively avoid the obstacle. When the obstacle becomes stationary, and can be considered to block the path of all agents, the obstacles should affect the global navigation, that is, the navigation mesh. Changing the NavMesh is called carving. The process detects which parts of the obstacle touches the NavMesh and carves holes into the NavMesh. This is computationally expensive operation, which is yet another compelling reason, why moving obstacles should be handled using collision avoidance. Local collision avoidance can be often used to steer around sparsely scattered obstacles too. Since the algorithm is local, it will only consider the next immediate collisions, and cannot steer around traps or handle cases where the an obstacle blocks a path. These cases can be solved using carving. Describing Off-mesh Links The connections between the NavMesh polygons are described using links inside the pathfinding system. Sometimes it is necessary to let the agent navigate across places which are not walkable, for example, jumping over a fence, or traversing through a closed door. These cases need to know the location of the action. These actions can be annotated using Off-Mesh Links which tell the pathfinder that a route exists through the specified link. This link can be later accessed when following the path, and the special action can be executed."

    "keywords": "NavMesh Agent component reference The NavMesh Agent component allows you to create characters (agents) that avoid each other as they move through a scene. Agents use the NavMesh to navigate through the space of the game and avoid each other and other moving obstacles. You can use the scripting API of the NavMesh Agent to handle pathfinding and spatial reasoning. To use the NavMesh Agent component, add it to a GameObject: Select the GameObject that represents your agent. In the Inspector, click Add Component. Select Navigation > NavMesh Agent. The NavMesh Agent component is displayed in the Inspector window. You can use this component to create NavMesh agents. For more details, see Create a NavMesh Agent. For more information about NavMesh agents, see About NavMesh agents. The following tables describe the properties available in the NavMesh agent component. Property Description Agent type Select the type of agent you want to create. This allows the agent to move along any NavMesh created for the selected agent type. Base offset Specify the offset of the collision cylinder in relation to the transform pivot point. Steering Property Description Speed Set the maximum speed (in Unity units per second) at which the agent can move along a path. Angular Speed Set the maximum rotation speed (in degrees per second) of the agent. Acceleration Set the maximum acceleration (in Unity units per second squared). Stopping Distance Specify how close the agent can get to its destination. The agent stops when it arrives this close to the destination location. Auto Braking Specify if the agent slows down as it approaches its destination. When enabled, the agent slows down as it approaches the destination. Disable this if you want the agent to move smoothly between multiple points (for example, if the agent is a guard on patrol). Obstacle Avoidance Property Description Radius Specify the distance from the agent's center that is used to calculate collisions between the agent and other GameObjects. Height Specify the height clearance that the agent needs to pass below an obstacle that is overhead. For example, the minimum height of a doorway or tunnel. Quality Select the obstacle avoidance quality. If you have a high number of agents, you can reduce the obstacle avoidance quality to reduce performance costs. If you set obstacle avoidance quality to none, then collisions resolve, but other agents and obstacles are not actively avoided. Priority Specify how agents behave as they avoid each other. Agents avoid other agents of higher priority and ignore other agents of lower priority. The value should be in the range 0–99 where lower numbers indicate higher priority. Path Finding Property Description Auto Traverse OffMesh Link Specify whether or not the agent automatically traverses OffMesh links. When enabled, the agent automatically traverses OffMesh links. Disable Auto Traverse OffMesh Link if you want to use animation or a specific way to traverse OffMesh links. Auto Repath Specify what the agent does when it reaches the end of a partial path. When there is no path to the destination, Unity generates a partial path to the reachable location that is closest to the destination. If this property is enabled, when the agent reaches the end of a partial path it tries again to find a path to the destination. Area Mask Specify which area types the agent considers as it tries to find a path. You can select multiple options. When you prepare meshes for NavMesh baking, you can set each mesh's area type. For example, you can mark stairs with a special area type, and restrict some agent types from using the stairs.

To use the NavMesh Surface component, navigate to GameObject > AI > NavMesh Surface. This creates an empty GameObject with a NavMesh Surface component attached to it. A Scene can contain multiple NavMesh Surfaces. You can add the NavMesh Surface component to any GameObject. This is useful for when you want to use the GameObject parenting Hierarchy to define which GameObjects contribute to the NavMesh. Parameters Property Description Agent Type The NavMesh Agent type using the NavMesh Surface. Use for bake settings and matching the NavMesh Agent to proper surfaces during pathfinding. Default Area Defines the area type generated when building the NavMesh. - Walkable (this is the default option) - Not Walkable - Jump Use the NavMesh Modifier component to modify the area type in more detail. Generate Links If this option is enabled, objects collected by the surface will be considered to generate links during the baking process. See the Links Generation section for more information. Use Geometry Select which geometry to use for baking. - Render Meshes – Use geometry from Render Meshes and Terrains. - Physics Colliders – Use geometry from Colliders and Terrains. Agents can move closer to the edge of the physical bounds of the environment with this option than they can with the Render Meshes option.

Use the main settings for the NavMesh Surface component to filter the input geometry on a broad scale. Fine tune how Unity treats input geometry on a per-GameObject basis, using the NavMesh Modifier component. The baking process automatically excludes GameObjects that have a NavMesh Agent or NavMesh Obstacle. They are dynamic users of the NavMesh, and so do not contribute to NavMesh building. Object collection Property Description Collect Objects Defines which GameObjects to use for baking. - All – Use all active GameObjects (this is the default option). - Volume – Use all active GameObjects overlapping the bounding volume. Geometry outside of the bounding volume but within the agent radius is taken into account for baking. - Children – Use all active GameObjects which are children of the NavMesh Surface component, in addition to the object the component is placed on. Include Layers Define the layers on which GameObjects are included in the bake process. In addition to Collect Objects, this allows for further exclusion of specific GameObjects from the bake (for example, effects or animated characters). This is set to Everything by default, but you can toggle options on (denoted by a tick) or off individually. Advanced Settings The Advanced settings section allows you to customize the following additional parameters: Property Description Override Voxel Size Controls how accurately Unity processes the input geometry for NavMesh baking (this is a tradeoff between speed and accuracy). Select the checkbox to enable. The default is unchecked (disabled). 3 voxels per Agent radius (6 per diameter) allows the capture of narrow passages, such as doors, while maintaining a quick baking time. For big open areas, using 1 or 2 voxels per radius speeds up baking. Tight indoor spots are better suited to smaller voxels, for example 4 to 6 voxels per radius. More than 8 voxels per radius does not usually provide much additional benefit. Override Tile Size In order to make the bake process parallel and memory efficient, the Scene is divided into tiles for baking. The white lines visible on the NavMesh are tile boundaries. The default tile size is 256 voxels, which provides a good tradeoff between memory usage and NavMesh fragmentation. To change this default tile size, check this checkbox and, in the Tile Size field, enter the number of voxels you want the Tile Size to be. The smaller the tiles, the more fragmented the NavMesh is. This can sometimes cause non-optimal paths. NavMesh carving also operates on tiles. If you have a lot of obstacles, you can often speed up carving by making the tile size smaller (for example around 64 to 128 voxels). If you plan to bake the NavMesh at runtime, using a smaller tile size to keep the maximum memory usage low. Minimum Region Area Allows you to cull away the small regions disconnected from the larger NavMesh. The process that builds the NavMesh does not retain the stretches of the mesh that have a surface size smaller than the specified value. Please note that some areas may not get removed despite the Minimum Region Area parameter. The NavMesh is built in parallel as a grid of tiles. If an area straddles a tile boundary, the area is not removed. The reason for this is that the area pruning step takes place at a stage in the build process when the surrounding tiles are not accessible. Build Height Mesh Enables the creation of additional data used for determining more accurately the height at any position on the NavMesh. See the Height Mesh section for more information. This option is available starting with Unity 2022.2.0f1."

Property Description Name Specify a name for the area type. Cost Specify the cost of traveling across this area. Costs are multipliers applied to the distance traveled across an area. A cost of 2 means an area is twice as difficult to cross as an area with a cost of 1. The default value is 1.

    "keywords": "OffMesh Link OffMeshLink component allows you to incorporate navigation shortcuts which cannot be represented using a walkable surface. For example, jumping over a ditch or a fence, or opening a door before walking through it, can all be described as OffMesh links. Properties Property Function Start Object describing the start location of the OffMesh Link. End Object describing the end location of the OffMesh Link. Cost Override If value is positive, use it when calculating path cost on processing a path request. Otherwise, the default cost is used (the cost of the area to which this game object belongs). If the Cost Override is set to the value 3.0, moving over the OffMesh link will be three times more expensive than moving the same distance on a default NavMesh area. The cost override becomes useful when you want to make the agents generally favor walking, but use the OffMesh link when the walk distance is clearly longer. Bi-Directional If enabled, the link can be traversed in either direction. Otherwise, it can only be traversed from Start to End. Activated Specifies if this link will used by the pathfinder (it will just be ignored if this is set to false). Auto Update Positions When enabled, the OffMesh link will be reconnected to the NavMesh when the end points move. If disabled the link will stay at its start location even if the end points are moved. Navigation Area Describes the navigation area type of the link. The area type allows you to apply a common traversal cost to similar area types and prevent certain characters from accessing the OffMesh Link based on the agent’s Area Mask.

If you have projects that were created with the Navigation feature in previous versions of Unity, the AI Navigation package is automatically installed and added to your project. You can then do one of the following: Continue to use your projects as they are Convert your projects to use the new package Remove old component scripts If your project uses the NavMesh Surface, NavMesh Modifier, NavMesh Modifier Volume or NavMesh Link components defined by scripts downloaded from Unity’s NavMeshComponents GitHub repository, then remove those scripts and any associated files before you add the AI Navigation package to your project. If you don’t remove these scripts, you might get conflicts and errors related to these components in the Console. The new components mirror the same behavior as the old components do in your project except when using the following components: The NavMesh Surface component now includes an option to use only the objects that have a NavMesh Modifier in the baking process. You can now specify whether or not to apply the NavMesh Modifier component to child objects in the hierarchy. Convert your project If you want to use the new package you need to convert your project(s). As part of the conversion process, the NavMesh Updater makes the following changes: Any NavMesh that was previously baked and embedded in the scene is now referenced from a NavMeshSurface component created on a new GameObject called Navigation. Any object that was marked with Navigation Static now has a NavMeshModifier component with the appropriate settings. To convert your project do the following: In the main menu go to Window > AI > NavMesh Updater. In the NavMesh Updater window, select which kind of data to convert. Click Initialize Converters to detect and display the types of data you selected. Select the data you want to convert. Click Convert Assets to complete the conversion. Create new agent types If the NavMeshes in different scenes are baked with different agent settings then you need to create new agent types to match those settings. To create the agent types do the following: In the main menu go to Window > AI > Navigation. Select Agents. Create new entries and specify the relevant settings. Assign new agent types When you have created the new agent types you then need to assign them as follows: Assign the newly created agent types to their respective NavMeshSurfaces in the Navigation created for that scene. Assign the agent types to the NavMeshAgents intended to use that NavMesh. To find the settings that were used for each existing NavMesh, select the NavMesh .asset file in the Project window. The NavMesh settings will be displayed in the Inspector."

The environment on the right uses a NavMeshSurface with no Height Mesh; the agent simply slides down the stairs. Note that some of these samples require that the Packages/manifest.json file of your project references the following default modules: \"com.unity.modules.physics\": \"1.0.0\", \"com.unity.modules.terrain\": \"1.0.0\", \"com.unity.modules.terrainphysics\": \"1.0.0\" Introduction to NavMesh The Navigation package allows you to set up pathfinding AI in your Unity project. Two fundamental concepts of pathfinding are (1) agents and (2) world representation. An agent is a game entity that travels autonomously between two points in a scene. In Unity, a GameObject can be turned into a navigation agent by adding a NavMeshAgent component to it. World representation is what allows the pathfinding program of an agent to understand the traversable surfaces of a world. It is a simplification of a 3D world. In Unity, a traversable surface is represented as a mesh of polygons which we refer to as NavMesh. To convert some or all of the geometry in your scene into a surface that is traversable by an agent, you can use the NavMeshSurface component. However, you must also generate the data of the NavMeshSurface by using the Bake button in the Inspector. The process of baking is what actually creates a representation of the geometry in your scene that agents and their pathfinding program can understand. Whenever there are modifications done to the scene's geometry that can impact the navigation, the related NavMeshSurface component must be rebaked. The baking process is not done automatically because it can be a long process depending on the size and complexity of the input geometry. Note that baking cannot be done from the Inspector during Playmode. In order for an agent to move, it must know its destination. In Unity, the destination of a NavMeshAgent can be set through code with the destination property or the SetDestination() method. You can find an example of this in the ClickToMove script. For more information, refer to the AI Navigation package manual. Agent Types The following agent types are created and used by the samples: 1. Name: Humanoid for Navigation Sample Radius: 0.5 Height: 2.0 Step Height: 0.75 Max Slope: 45 2. Name: Ogre for Navigation Sample Radius: 1.0 Height: 2.0 Step Height: 0.4 Max Slope: 36"

    "title": "Changelog | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Changelog [1.8.18] - 2024-09-04 Added Added the UNITY_BURST_DISABLE_COMPILATION environment variable as an alternative to the --burst-disable-compilation command-line argument Removed Changed Fixed Static fields used in static constructors were sometimes incorrectly set to read only, despite being written. Fixed a case of the editor getting stuck loading during a domain reload if Burst was set to synchronous compilation Fixed hashing bug that could occur when method signatures differed only by generic parameter count Branches within if (cpufeaturesupported) blocks could cause the transform pass to miss identify which blocks are supporting which features, leading to errors at compile time about intrinsics not being in matching blocks. Fixed 'cannot open input file ucrt.lib' error when building for Universal Windows Platform and targeting SDK 10.0.26100.0 Known Issues [1.8.17] - 2024-07-22 Added Removed Changed Improved performance of Burst-compiled code in the Windows x64 Editor by only emitting context-saving code when the code being compiled contains a throw Improved error message for pointer-like types in non-readonly static fields ARM 32-bit is no longer built for Universal Windows Platform when targeting SDK 10.0.26100.0 or newer Fixed Fixed another compiler crash caused by faulty alias analysis BurstAotSettings files are no longer written to disk unless default settings are changed Fixed the BurstDebugInformation_DoNotShip folder not being saved outside the player build folder for Embedded Linux and QNX platforms Fixed direct negation of enums was not correctly promoting the underlying type, causing wrong results. Fixed that Mathf.Approximately would return the wrong result approximately all of the time Fixed an issue with default interface methods which would result in compiler errors due to IL corruption. Creating a project with a space in the path would cause burst to fail on windows arm64. Fixed 'Failed to find Windows SDK' error when targeting the latest installed Windows SDK version for Universal Windows Platform builds Known Issues [1.8.16] - 2024-05-29 Fixed Fixed compiler crash caused by faulty alias analysis [1.8.15] - 2024-05-10 Added Removed Changed Fixed An issue with auto promotion from bool to float that can occur with newer Roslyn. Fixed compilation error when trying to use MemoryMarshal.GetReference on Spans Fixed crash caused by faulty no-alias analysis Fix build error when Product Name contains illegal path characters. Improved the compilation time for projects with many assemblies/assembly-define symbols Known Issues [1.8.14] - 2024-04-04 Fixed Fixed burst sometimes throwing FileNotFoundException Fixed incorrect handling of [Conditional] attributes in some circumstances Fixed that some or all scripting symbol defines wouldn't be known by Burst in player builds Added Removed Changed [1.8.13] - 2024-02-29 Added Added clearer diagnostic error for certain bad usages of IsSupportedXXX intrinsics. Added support for Burst with the visionOS Simulator SDK. Added support for Windows Arm64. Fixed Fixed InvalidCompilerException when usage of IsSupportedXXX intrinsic results in no branches being generated. Fixed information in documentation regarding scheduling generic jobs through generic methods. Fixed a crash caused by arithmetic or bitwise negation on native integers followed by a cast to a pointer. Fixed that the burst debug information folder would sometimes be saved in project root folder. Fixed System.ArgumentNullException exception in ILPostProcessing when encountering a library using mscorlib Fixed an issue where if two modules were referencing the same external method (dllImport) an internal compiler error could occur - \"Burst internal compiler error: Burst.Compiler.IL.CompilerException: Error while verifying module: DISubprogram attached to more than one function\" Fixed \"Failed to find entry-points: ... An item with the same key has already been added\" error that could occur in the presence of precompiled (usually obfuscated) assemblies that contained methods overloaded only by return type Removed Changed Known Issues [1.8.12] - 2024-01-02 Fixed Fixed the managed fallback for bursts intrinsic functions cvt_ss2si, cvtss_si32, and cvtss_si64 to follow midpoint rounding standard of nearest even. Fixed an issue where use of certain intrinsics could cause a compile error even if properly guarded by the appropriate IsXXXSupported property. If an exception is thrown from burst compiled code in the Editor on Windows there was potential for certain callee saved registers to be corrupted. In order to fix this ( editor only - player builds are unaffected), we now save some additional context on each entry point. Fixed burst not differentiating between overloaded generic functions such as T foo(int val) and T foo(T val) when the function calls are foo(1); foo (1). Burst would previously only compile the T foo(T val) function. Fixed android builds throwing a NullReferenceException. Fixed arithmetic and bitwise negation on native integers. Fixed an issue where underflows of nint and nuint at compile time would lead to incorrect code. Burst recompiles assemblies due to hashes mismatching because of the way assembly defines are combined into the hash. Fixed constant SHUFFLE function not seen as a constant when called indirectly through a FunctionPointer Added Removed Changed Update default LLVM to version 16 Known Issues [1.8.11] - 2023-11-16 Added Burst support for Apple visionOS [1.8.10] - 2023-11-02 Fixed Fixed the Burst Inspector not displaying target methods if namespace/class contained the method name. Linking libstdc++/libc++ statically on HMI platforms Fixed an issue that caused an empty variable to be returned if it is between a zero initializer Native debug information would fail to reflect the contents of parameters to functions. For native debug information, type symbols can now be referenced using :: separator between namespaces (C++ style) - E.g. Example.Type becomes Example::Type. Fixed that changing certain player build platform settings (like SDK version) would not trigger Burst to recompile Fixed invalid burst string formats leading to internal compiler error. Fixed QNX player builds on 32-bit ARM Fixed an error thrown by the Burst Inspector when opening a non-static job with special characters in its name Fixed an issue that caused alignments for global values to be wrong, which could lead to a rare AVX2 specific crash. Added Added support for System.Math functions Acosh, Asinh, Atanh, Cbrt, CopySign, Log2, SinCos, FusedMultiplyAdd, and ILogB Removed Remove all code specific to DOTS Runtime Changed Use mimalloc as our native allocator on Windows to speed up concurrently executing LLVM work Known Issues [1.8.9] - 2023-09-22 Changed Minor behind-the-scenes changes that should not affect users. [1.8.8] - 2023-07-24 Fixed Fixed error when trying to use direct call to a nested protected class Fixed that converting a negated unsigned type to a float would produce a mismatching value in Burst versus .Net/Mono Fixed that the Burst Inspector handled negation of unsigned types differently than .Net for static readonly fields or static constructors Fixed Burst sometimes returning wrong value for static readonly fields or static constructors. Fixed a possible source of invalid alignment, avx2 storing to stack was given a slot with the wrong alignment.

Fix compiler crash when compiling different assemblies that define methods or types with the exact same name and namespace Fixed using Armv9 target in the Burst Inspector not formatting the assembly. Fixed that jobs wouldn't be Burst compiled for player builds with high stripping Fixed burst not being able to find external function leading to crashing the Editor Prevented Burst emitting errors even when Burst was disabled via the --burst-disable-compilation command line option Under some conditions (if the error in compilation occurred in a location that didn't have valid debug information), building a player might not generate any files, and not display any errors. Fixed uint to float conversion edge-case Fixed syntax highlight missing for some ARM instructions. Added Added support for default interface methods Added ability to support hashing against different target frameworks. Added support for string interpolation in exception messages Removed Changed Fixed a compile-time performance regression in 1.8.7 that could result in slower Burst compilation and increased memory usage during compilation Direct call is now correctly disabled for methods that are decorated with both [BurstCompile] and [UnmanagedCallersOnly] attributes (such methods shouldn't be called directly from managed code) Add support for Math.Clamp (this API is available when Api Compatibility Level is set to .NET Standard 2.1) Known Issues [1.8.7] - 2023-06-07 Added Add proper license attribution for MUSL and SLEEF libraries. Removed Changed Changed focus for initial Burst Inspector focus to actually get the search hit in focus. Fixed Fix QNX builds using the qnxInstallationPath editor build setting Fixed an issue causing source file handles to be left open (preventing saving in an ide, if in debug scripting mode and the file is used in the burst path). Fixed an issue when targeting multiple cpu architectures (e.g. SSE2 & AVX2) that under some circumstances would lead to code attempting to execute paths not designed for that cpu. Fixed an issue that caused builds to fail due to the System.Diagnostics.Tracing assembly not being found Fixed a warning that occurred when opening Burst AOT Settings while in Play Mode Fixed a hashing error that could occur when an operator overload method is used as a Burst entry point Fixed crash on linux if debug logging was enabled. Fixed \"The specified path is not of a legal form (empty)\" error Calls to methods with multiple [Conditional] attributes are now kept if any one of the conditions are met Fixed Burst implementation of IntPtr.GetHashCode() being different than .Net Fixed an issue that caused the digits and MidpointRounding parameters of Math.Round be ignored Known Issues [1.8.4] - 2023-03-20 Fixed Fixed possible deadlock when compiling after domain reload Fixed incorrect codegen when having multiple try-finally blocks inside another try-finally block (for example from foreach loops) Domain completed stall when switching between debug/release scripting modes when burst compilation is needed for items in the new domain. Fixed \"An item with the same key has already been added\" compiler error that could occur when duplicate field names were present in obfuscated assemblies Fixed \"Failed to find entry-points: Mono.Cecil.AssemblyResolutionException: Failed to resolve assembly\" error that was displayed when Burst tried to compile an assembly that had C# compilation errors Fixed code-gen issue where side-effects before a conditional throw would be ignored Burst managed breakpoints might fail to work, after a domain reload. Fixed that some changes made to versioned assemblies wouldn't get picked up and compiled by Burst Fixed line highlight and register highlight not clearing when Burst Inspector settings change. Fixed Burst compilation error relating to UnityEngine.Assertions.Assert.Fail when doing player builds with high stripping settings Fixed a BadImageFormatException error that could occur in some player builds Neon intrinsics: fixed default target CPU for Arm Mac Standalone builds Fixed MethodDecoderException when trying to call CompileFunctionPointer on a nested static method Fixed incorrect pdb path for AoT dll libraries Fixed inaccurate stacktraces when throwing an exception from Burst in specific cases Fixed \"An item with the same key has already been added\" hashing error that could occur if obfuscators changed nested type names to have the same name and different namespaces Added Add support for ChromeOS in Unity versions 2020.3 and 2019.4. Windows/ARM64 targeting support Removed Changed Changed Burst Inspector input handling so that arrow-keys can be used to select in search boxes. Made Burst Inspector's target job load asynchronous. Known Issues [1.8.3] - 2023-01-30 Added Added selection of line and highlight of selected line and selected lines register usage. FunctionPointer ()::Invoke usage is now checked and patched to ensure the calling convention is compatible with burst. Added SIMD smell test to the Burst Inspector, highlighting ARM or x86-64 SIMD instruction differently depending on whether they work for packed or scalar inputs. Added a toggle for filtering out \".Generated\" jobs from the Burst Inspector target job list. Added a Burst AOT setting for the kind of debug information generated for player builds Fixed Fixed AoT linking error on Windows Link based linkers when file paths (typically user names/home folders) contain non-ASCII characters. Fixed ARM vector registers not being highlighted. Fixed Burst Inspector sometimes throwing ArugmentOutOfRangeException when copying without color-tags from assembly that is colored. Fixes error when calling direct call method from background thread without having previously called a BurstCompiler API from the main thread Fixes \"Plain Without Debug Information\" outputting assembly with debug information. Fixed a hashing error that could occur when a struct implements a generic interface multiple times with different generic parameters An issue that could cause function pointers to point to the wrong burst function, if a domain reload occurs and a compilation started before the reload, completes soon after. Fixed bug in a small set of managed fallback versions of intrinsics, where the bitwise representation of float values would not be maintained Fixed player build error that could occur if the project contains an assembly whose name doesn't match the assembly filename Crashes on 32bit cpus when an entry point with byvalue paramaters was called, when using dispatch (multiple supported cpu targets). Fixed module verification errors when using overloaded functions as function pointers Fixed an issue the definition order of overloaded methods with function pointer parameters would decide which overload was actually being used Fixed compiler AccessViolationException that could occur when compiling two or more types with the same name but different source assemblies Burst now updates its list of assembly paths if they change, for instance - adding packages that contain precompiled assemblies. Fixed a stall that could occur at Editor shutdown Fixed BC1361 error when trying to compile large static readonly arrays. Fixed compilation error when using CompileFunctionPointer from Burst in code compiled with Roslyn on .NET 7+ Fixed a BadImageFormatException error that could occur in DOTS Runtime builds Fixed the inspector job tree view splitting jobs, with '.' in their parameters. Fixed internal compiler error when implcitly converting an array to a Span Fixed managed fallback implementation of Sse4_2.cmpestrs \"LLVM IR Optimisation Diagnostics\" tab in Burst Inspector was blank if \"Native Debug Mode Compilation\" was enabled; this is now fixed Fixed burst tree view items leading to wrong job if some jobs where hidden from view by filter or similar. Fixed \"Callee/caller attribute ABI did not match!\" error that could occur in certain player builds when calling an entry point that had at least one struct-by-value parameter Fixed namespace collision that could occur between Unity.Burst.Cecil.dll and the com.unity.nuget.mono-cecil package Enum values cast to integers in a format string previously output the enum type name; now the integer value is correctly output Fix Burst compilation on QNX Arm Fixed visual artifact in Burst Inspector, where block of enhanced code was cut at the bottom. Fixed compiler crash when invoking FunctionPointers based on a generic delegate in DOTS Runtime Fixed internal compiler error that occurred when creating debug metadata from certain obfuscated dlls Fixed \"Assertion failed on expression: \"exception == SCRIPTING_NULL\" errors and editor crash when the project path contained multi-byte Unicode characters Changed Changed burst inspector source location comments from \"===\" to either \";\" or \"#\" depending on the given assembly kind. Changed horizontal code focus in the Burst Inspector to only scroll when branches fill more than half the space Changes so target job list in the Burst Inspector is a fold-able/expandable tree view, instead of a simple list. Improved how optimisation remarks are displayed in the \"LLVM IR Optimisation Diagnostics\" tab in Burst Inspector to make them more useful Burst now only generates full debug information when \"Native Debug Mode Compilation\" and script debug information is enabled Removed Known Issues [1.8.2] - 2022-11-18 Added Changed Fixed Fixed an issue where sometimes the wrong body of an overloaded entrypoint would be used Failing to link if ; in path Fixed Burst being disabled in the Editor after changing script optimization mode (i.e. from Release to Debug or vica-versa) C# Debug information was incorrectly ignored for methods that had multiple source files. This caused native debug information to be dropped for code generated methods, and prevented the disabling of burst for such methods when a managed break point was set in Unity 2022.2 or greater (see https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.burst@1.8/manual/debugging-profiling-tools.html). Pointer addition of byte would incorrectly sign extend the byte, instead of zero extend. lib_burst_generated.txt was not being output. Player stripping levels higher than minimal would fail to build with burst if they used String.Formatters, String Copy, or BurstDiscard. Fixed error when building player caused by calling an entrypoint method from within other Burst-compiled code iOS/tvOS burst libraries are now using explicit min os version, as configured in player settings. Fixed Burst AOT setting \"Enable Optimizations\" not being applied in player builds Fixed player builds not being recompiled when changing only Burst AOT settings (and changing nothing else) in Unity 2022.2+ Error caused by the MonoDebuggerHandling.dll requiring VCRuntime to be installed. Removed Known Issues [1.8.1] - 2022-10-12 Added Added a custom lld wrapper, to save package space in transit and on disk. Added hover box information for assembly instructions. Changed Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 14.0.6 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project. Ensured our executables and libraries on macOS and Linux are stripped to reduce package size. Changed how we handle domain reloads within Burst to avoid paying a 250ms cost on each domain reload when using Burst. With the relaxation in Unity 2022.2 or newer that we can call CompileFunctionPointer from a background thread, we now use this mechanism in Burst to handle Direct Call methods, resulting in a cost saving during Domain Reload. Added a categorized index of Neon intrinsics supported in Burst to the Manual Changed the documentation so that it is super clear that exceptions in player builds cause the application to abort. Fixed Fixed a compiler crash that could occur with code that followed the pattern Debug.Log($\"{variable}\") Compiling with line only debug information could cause a compiler crash on certain platforms PDB path associated with windows player dll had the wrong filename, resulting in broken symbols. Fixed documentation issues with Neon intrinsics where the comparison operation would not match the actual one Fixed bug that could occur when swapping large structs by value Fixed \"Unable to resolve type T. Reason: Unknown.\" error when accessing a field of a struct referenced via a pointer behind a reference. Fixed some arm64 instructions not being labelled as instructions. If burst is disabled, and an assembly is changed, burst won't recompile that assembly once burst is re-enabled. Removed Known Issues [1.8.0] - 2022-09-13 Added Added experimental atomic and/or operations to Burst. Changed math.fmod in combination with a Burst job compiled with FloatPrecision.Low will now generate a more optimized low-precision version of the function. Burst now respects the checkbox \"Enable Armv9 Security Features for Arm64\" in the Player settings, making Android builds generate PAC/BTI instructions if enabled. In Burst AOT Settings, only the relevant CPU Architectures dropdowns for the current build target and architecture are now displayed The callstack of the invalid external call is now included when reporting BC1091 Changed so code is focused when branch arrows are present. Changed so Burst reported errors are not collapsible. Removed Fixed An Internal Compiler Error that could occur if a function that requires a struct ret (due to ABI) has been discarded by other logic. Fixed a bug with locally declared array variables in functions where storing null into them could cause invalid codegen. Fixed a bug in Burst player builds where sufficiently complicated Bursted code could cause a deadlock deep within LLVM. Fixed that UWP builds wouldn't respect the specified \"Target SDK Version\" and \"Visual Studio Version\" settings Fixed Burst inspector sometimes freezing when selecting between blocks. Fixed the Burst Inspector sometimes becoming unresponsive when selecting text. Fixed a race condition with the Burst log timings such that previously reported results could be included in subsequently reported timings. Fixed the managed fallbacks for bzhi and bextr to match what the native hardware instructions do. Fixed a bug in the static readonly constant expression evaluation (what we call the IL interpreter) whereby it would not truncate unsigned integers correctly. Fixed that compilation would have full debug info forced on Fixed incorrect code-gen when a function is both used normally and as a function-pointer Known Issues The PDB path associated with the Windows Player dll is incorrect, resulting in broken symbols. [1.8.0-pre.2] - 2022-08-03 Fixed Fixed hashing bug that could occur when a function pointer type is used in a method parameter Fix selection and copying of folded blocks Fixed hashing error that could occur in the presence of multiple synthesized explicit interface implementations with the same name and signature Fixed a compiler crash if users used __refvalue or __arglist in Burst. Neither of these are supported, but now we will nicely tell you via a compiler error that they aren't supported. Fixed a compiler error when trying to acquire the function pointer of a generic function from Bursted code. Fix some ARM branch instructions not being processed as such. Using a function only through a C# function pointer could cause a crash Whitespace changes in ILPP'd assemblies would not be detected. Issue where a warning could be generated about the debug information version mismatching warning: ignoring debug info with an invalid version (0) during link. Interface methods where not being hashed correctly for constrained types, which would result in burst failing to recompile code that had changed in an implementation class. Fixed a safety check bug with Span/ReadOnlySpan and Slice(start, length) where if start + length was equal to the Length of the original span, the safety check would incorrectly report an out-of-bounds access. Linking issue when exports differ only by module. Disabling Burst from the command line via --burst-disable-compilation no longer results in Burst errors when building a player for Android Corrupted binary could be produced on M1 if there was not enough space for UUID+codesign injection. ;'s in paths would cause burst to fail. Note - Also requires a fix in the Editor, so if your project has ;'s in its path, the workaround is to remove the ; from the folder name for now. Fixed error when compiling assemblies with spaces in their names Fixed access violation race condition bug Fixed a bug where static fields in generic types could in some situations be initialized with the incorrect value Fixed last line in Burst Inspector not being select-able using the mouse cursor. Fix error that occurs with a specific formulation of IL, using xx with an early out escape and unbalanced calculation stack. (Object reference not set to an instance of ... in CollectBlock.ToVisitOrder) Changed Changed burst inspector toggles to popup menus. Removed label from burst inspector popup menu into the menu itself. Used explicit namespace for UnityEditor.PackageManager.Events to avoid conflicts. Improved \"hashing\" performance. This is the part of Burst that determines whether anything significant has changed in .NET assemblies, and therefore whether that assembly to be compiled. Entry point function names weren't always included in crash callstacks; now they are Search pattern from previous job is not carried over to the new. Changed so block of 1 line cannot be folded in the Burst Inspector Added Setting a breakpoint in an attached managed debugger (Rider/VS Unity Debugger...) on a method that is burst compiled, will switch off the burst code path for that method, allowing it to be debugged as normal. Added toggle to filter Unity tests on and off. Assembly is now searchable either through CTRL + f or the contex menu associated with the inspector view. Search options include case sensitivity, whole word match, and regex. Intrinsic support for UnsafeUtility.IsNativeContainerType Added an actual definition for HPC# in the package docs. Check that calling convention is correctly set to Cdecl for functions whose addresses are taken via ldftn. Added focus on current job in the burst inspector. Added copy to burst inspector, which ignores underlying color tags. Removed Known Issues [1.8.0-pre.1] - 2022-05-06 Changed Always preserve frame pointers in Burst. This results in a neglible performance hit (less than 0.5% in benchmarks), but ensures that stack recovery for stack traces is always possible. Class libraries are now built with netstandard 2.0 The minimum Xcode version to build for iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS with Burst is now 12.0.0. Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 13.0.1 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project. Fixed \"error while hashing\" message that could appear during compilation Made Burst explicitly check for any compilation requests that came from AssemblyBuilder, and do not compile these with Burst. These exist outside the normal compilation pipeline, and Burst could not support them (but we now explicitly check for that case). Made Burst's ILPP 22% faster by caching dependent assemblies that the being-processed assembly uses. Changed how we process static readonly fields in static constructors such that we'll allow more computational budget per static field. This fixes the case where having too many static readonly variables in a single static constructor could fail to compile, while they would work if each was in their own static constructors. Collapsed block of code in burst inspector now shows the blocks first line of code. Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 14.0.0 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project. Changed the default alignment for SharedStatic's from 4 to 16. Added Branches now highlights when you hover them. Branches are clickable; directing the view to the other end of the branch when clicked. Added support for the System.Runtime.CompilerServices.IsExternalInit workaround documented here into Burst when used in 2022.1+. Enabled keyboard navigation in the right pane of the burst inspector. Added version number to debug metadata for llvm Experimental support for Armv9 SVE2 CPU target for Android Added a Target Arm64 CPU setting in Burst AOT Settings for Android Removed Removed the requirement that BurstLoader has to initialize BurstReflection during a domain reload, making BurstLoader setup 2x faster during domain reloads. Fixed Error if install in build folder is used without ever using a regular build. Fixed a performance regression with IJobParallelFor where vectorization didn't happen for cases where it previously would have. Fixed a compiler miscompile if you loaded a static readonly v128 and passed it straight to a function as an argument. Removed implicit dependencies to pre-compile binaries in CodeGen which would otherwise cause assembly resolution conflicts. Fixed a Unity 2021.2 and newer bug that manifested with UWP builds - we were using the wrong unityaot folder in the Unity editor distribution with Burst. Fixed a really subtle caching bug in the compiler where if you had a job that compiled successfully at least once, then it failed (you used managed state for instance), then you closed the editor and restarted, if the compiler threads started in precisely a strange combination then Burst might accidentally never recompile the job which failed previously. Fixed potential hang in Editor when compiling a Burst entry point method that is defined in a generic class Fix for the X.pdb: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process issue our users were seeing. We were taking a FileShare.Read lock, when we needed to take FileShare.ReadWrite. Fixed a bug where the compiler would reject a try/finally statement if it was the first thing in a method Fixed a performance regression affecting some vectorization in Burst 1.7+ (LLVM 12+). Inspector performance regression. Improved UWP linker error message to clarify which VS components need to be installed for UWP Fixed a bug that meant Burst was accidentally enabled in secondary Unity processes, including the asset import worker and out-of-process profiler (see changelog entry for 1.6.0-pre.1 for more context around this) Keybindings for copy and selection did not depend on OS. Right pane vertical scrollbar not always showing correctly. Inspector font style changing when entering and exiting play mode. Fixed access violation error that could occur when reading from a static readonly variable Made --burst-force-sync-compilation command-line option actually work Fixed a bug that was exposed by a Script Updater running against the Entities tests, whereby if some sort of pre-domain-reload code (some sort of teardown like thing) called into Burst, the script updater could have caused Burst to purge valid function pointers, resulting in us trying to execute a DLL location that we had already unloaded. Fixed a super rare bug whereby if you kicked off two compilations very close together (most likely when running Unity in some sort of headless build-a-player mode), Burst could throw an exception on a burst hash cache file being locked by the process. Fix a bug where if you had a long running compilation and a new compilation came in, some threads in the thread pool could (if unlucky) block trying to dirty the assembly in our Burst caching infrastructure while waiting for the compilation to complete. Fix a bug where codegen differences could occur when using a local vector variable that was being captured by reference and passed to a called function, versus when it wasn't. Fixed an exception that could occur if you had the Burst AOT Settings menu docked in the Editor, and then did a player build. Trying to change any of the Burst AOT Settings would throw an exception (unless you closed and reopened the Burst AOT Settings). Fixed a bug where we could leave background tasks around forever when we had actually completed them (could only happen if two re-compilation requests arrived close together, meaning we'd cancel the first but never report to the background tasks that we had cancelled them!). Fix the Burst link.xml output to preserve C# methods we rely on, alongside the static constructors that we preserved previously. Fixed errors when working with paths containing special characters Fixed a bug where if you used FloatMode.Fast with math.pow, where the y argument to math.pow was actually sourced from an integer, illegal codegen would be generated (LLVM would try and call out to powf from the cstdlib). Worked around an ordering issue with post-processing in 2020.3 and earlier by deferring the early compilation of script assemblies in the editor until the entire pipeline has completed. Fixed a bug in 2022.1+ where calling Debug.Log in a static constructor would result in a Burst failure. Fixed another rare case of the file-is-locked bug where the Burst IL Post Processor could incorrectly hold a file lock on a pdb. Fixed a bug when calling profiling CreateMarker on iOS, Burst could fail at runtime saying it was unable to find CreateMarker__Unmanaged. Fixed that the crc32_u64 second parameter should have been a ulong. Added a new ulong variant and marked the old long variant as [Obsolete]. Fixed a bug where using ReinterpretStore(someIndex, (ushort)someValue) could cause an internal compiler error in Burst. Fixed a potential deadlock whereby if Burst was compiling in the background (the background tasks window showed Burst in it) and a user switched from release to debug in the editor, Burst could cause a deadlock. A potential issue with the debug info mover pass, that meant it only affected the first entry point in a module Fixed hashing error that could occur with unbound generic type Fixed a bug where if you had synchronous compilation on a job, disabled Burst compilation and entered playmode, then exited playmode, and finally re-enabled Burst compilation, a hang could occur. Fixed a bug where toggling Burst enable <-> disable during a playmode execution using Burst, and then attaching the managed debugger, could cause an editor crash. Fixed a memory leak where during hashing we'd pin a GC object and never unpin and free it. Fix burst inspector sometimes stalling during loading for script reloads. Fixed a super rare bug where Burst could hit an internal error with System.InvalidOperationException: Nullable object must have a value. Fixed a regression where out parameters of C# 9.0 function pointers weren't working in Burst. Fixed internal compiler error when encountering a calli with closed generics Fixed bug in static constructor ordering in the presence of indirect dependencies between static constructors (i.e. static constructor -> static method -> static constructor) that could result in a runtime crash Added workaround for \"cannot dlopen until fork() handlers have completed\" issue seen in macOS 12.3 Fixed compiler crash when trying to dynamically call BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer in Burst-compiled code Fix compiler crash when the only usage of a static field was in a formatted exception string Fixed burst inspector sometimes not rendering text or rendering text on top of other text. Fixed selection rendering off-by-one error at last line of each block. Fixed a bug with Span and ReadOnlySpan types where if the indices used were not already 32-bit signed integers, an internal compiler error would occur if running with safety checks enabled. Fixed a really convoluted bug that could manifest in Burst returning out of date cached libraries, which would manifest as random exceptions in Burst jobs/function-pointers (users deleting the BurstCache would workaround the bug). Known Issues [1.7.0-pre.2] - 2021-12-06 Changed Improved the compiler performance when doing large struct copies by detecting more cases where a load/store can be safely converted to a move-memory operation. Used BuildReport::summary::subtarget to detect headless (server) player builds on 2022.1+. Don't move pdbs out of build folder for UWP builds. Changed how we display the timings when a user has the Show Timings option enabled in the Burst menu, by cleaning up and presenting the information in a (hopefully!) clearer way. Fixed Fixed constant folding when using Hint.Likely or Hint.Unlikely intrinsics - the compiler is now able to fold these calls away entirely if the input value is constant. Fixed an internal compiler error when casting a void* to a pointer-to-vector and then access the element. One Definition Rule optimisation would break if multiple modules shared static constructors due to an issue with sharing code but not data. Fixed type initialization error, and invalid log messages about needing to add [MonoPInvokeCallback] to be compatible with IL2CPP, that could occur in a player build with Burst disabled ILPP issue for dots runtime whereby a calli patch could generate bad IL if the first instruction replaced was the target of a branch. Fixed a bug where fixed used in conjunction with Span or ReadOnlySpan would cause a compiler error. Fixed a codegen issue with Unity 2021.2 and System.Buffer.MemoryCopy. Fixed compiler crash when trying to load a generic static field Fixed \"UnityException: CompileAsyncDelegateMethod can only be called from the main thread.\" error that was logged in standalone players when the first invocation of a direct-call method was from a background thread Fix the very rare bug whereby the Burst Hash Cache files (*.bhc) will sometimes cause an exception in the editor log. Fixed the documentation to note that the System.Runtime.CompilerServices attributes [CallerLineNumber], [CallerMemberName], and [CallerFilePath] work with Burst, with the restriction that you cannot format the [CallerMemberName], and [CallerFilePath] strings yet. Fixed an issue where with optimizations disabled, using half conversions on platforms that did not natively support half could cause linker errors. Fix error when trying to Direct Call a method belonging to a private nested type Fixed some memory leaks between the C# and C++ parts of the Burst compiler, and added some CI tooling to ensure this doesn't happen again. Fixed a bug where our [BurstCompile] job finding code would not find methods in generic base classes in places where we knew the concrete-generic type (for instance struct Foo<T> { [BurstCompile] struct MyJob : IJob { void Execute() {} } }, struct Bar<T> : Foo<T> {}, and struct Haz : Bar<int> {} - we wouldn't find the concrete Foo<int>::MyJob in Burst). Fixed editor crash when trying to debug a DirectCalled method Fixed a bug whereby complicated try/finally nesting could trip up the compiler. Fixed a bug in the fixed string processing whereby we'd miscompile a fixed string that was within a struct inside a SharedStatic (depending on how it was used). Fixed a bug in the entry-point finding code whereby we wouldn't correctly resolve a nested generic struct's job if it was within a concrete generic class that was outwith the root assembly set. Added Ability to partially select and copy text in the burst inspector. Right clicking the inspector view reveals a context menu, allowing selecting all text and copying selection. Removed The button \"Copy to Clipboard\". Removed Newtonsoft.Json as a dependency Known Issues [1.7.0-pre.1] - 2021-10-21 Fixed Fixed an issue where dsym folders would be not be copied across to the DoNotShip folder when building a multi architecture build for mac os. Fixed bug that could lead to \"Failed to resolve method with name hash X and signature hash Y\" compiler error Fixed compiler error that occurred when calling BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer with a delegate type that was decorated with a custom attribute Linking would fail on non-Windows platforms if the project folder contained a single-quote Fixed the \"could not find path tempburstlibs\" error message popping up when building for Android and Burst is disabled Fixed bug that could lead to incorrect compiler errors for calls to GetHashCode from a generic type Incorrect conversions between signed and unsigned vector types Detects if the simulator is the target of a player build for iOS/tvOS and disables burst, as at present this configuration is not supported by burst. [SkipLocalsInit] now correctly doesn't zero-initialize variables in a function (previously it only avoided zero-initialization of stackalloc created variables). Fixed a bug whereby sometimes some LLVM intrinsics could be incorrectly marked as unused causing invalid codegen with calls to math.acos. The cache for pdbs was becoming stale. This caused issues with wrong source information being shown in the inspector, and potentially wrong debug information being generated for bursted code in editor sessions. Missing output messages from some tools when a failure occurred. Fixed a bug with sqrt_ps for 128-bit types where it would crash the compiler. ArgumentOutOfRangeException due to _renderBlockStart and _renderBlockEnd not being probably initialized when all blocks were above the scroll position. Arrows were rendered even though they were not within the current view. Made it save the actual line numbers for code blocks in _blockLine even when the block is below the view. Removed the starting newline character when copying, and when rendering plain assembly kind. Fixed a bug where a player build that had multiple assemblies that had structs declared with the same name and same contents but different [BurstCompile] methods in them, would wrongly only pick a single struct to Burst-compile. Crash in burst module initialization if multiple modules are compiled and then linked in a different order. Fixed our platform documentation to accurately reflect the current supported platforms with Burst. Inspector menu buttons were seen as available, even though they were not supported, when viewing i.e. .NET IL code. Burst will now handle projects special characters in their project-name Static constructor sorting didn't account for dependencies within calls' IL Static constructor cyclic checks also included method calls when this is not necessary and fails on burst runtime logging code Fixed the bug @tertle found when loading a vector from a struct pointer that is marked as in. Fixed that implicitly casting a scalar half to a vector type would cause the compiler to crash Fixed a crash that could occur when loading legacy Burst AOT settings and then entering play mode Stack overflow caused by placement of alloca under certain function transforms. linker errors on macOS due to long command lines, swapped to using filelists for inputs. Fixed issue that could cause bcl.exe to fail with an exit code of 1 but not output any compilation errors Added Added support for DOTS Runtime running / loading .Net Core assemblies. Added support for System.Span<T> and System.ReadOnlySpan<T> within Bursted code. These types are not allowed as entry-point arguments. Folding/collapsing code in inspector Branch arrows (can be switched off) Automatically collapses less important blocks of disasssembly (focuses on code). Burst now generates a link.xml automatically to avoid issues with stripping causing missing symbols at runtime from static constructor usage. Removed Removed the Use Platform SDK Linker option from Burst AOT Settings for desktop platforms. Removed the player build BC1370 exception warnings as users only found them annoying. Changed Made the cost of initializing Direct Call methods for execution 33x faster during domain reload. Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 12.0.0 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project. Change the optimization pipeline to run the loop unroller exclusively after the loop vectorizer. This improves codegen in a lot of cases (mostly because the SLP vectorizer is unable to vectorize all the code that the loop unroller could have). Intrinsics: Neon vst1 APIs are now fully supported Made fmod and floating-point modulus use a faster algorithm to improve performance. Made the SharedStatic initialization cost during static constructor initialization time 13.3x faster. Improved iteration time by triggering Burst compilation immediately after .NET assemblies have been compiled Upgraded the minimum supported PS4 SDK to 8.00. Updated the minimum Xcode required for Burst to compile for the Apple iOS/tvOS plaforms to 12.0. Burst now waits for all threads to complete on shutdown, rather than performing a thread abort, as that could lead to a race condition with Dispose. Known Issues Burst does not work correctly when a project has a semi-colon in its name [1.6.0-pre.3] - 2021-07-27 Fixed Fixed a bug where methods with the same name and namespace, but in different assemblies, could resolve to the wrong method. Burst no longer logs a warning when opening the standalone Profiler Fixed an UnauthorizedAccessException that could occur when using Burst in players built for the macOS App Sandbox Fixed a bug that could cause an incorrect compilation error when using a primitive type as a generic argument in a static method entry point Crash due to member function debug information on tvOS. Fix documentation to make clear that ref / out parameters are supported on [BurstDiscard] methods. Fixed a NullReferenceException in the Burst compiler when multi-dimensional arrays were used. The compiler now produces a correct error message telling users that multi-dimensional arrays are not supported by Burst. Fixed DOTS Runtime Job Marshalling behaviour to properly handle marshalling generic Job types when not all closed forms of the generic type require marshalling. Fixed a Burst package warning in our editor compiler integration with respect to BuildOptions.EnableHeadlessMode. Fixed small race which could cause an unexpected exception when finishing a standalone compilation task. Building for Apple Silicon architecture on macOS would produce a universal binary, now it behaves correctly. tvOS/iOS and other statically linked platforms would fail to burst compile if the burst compiled code contained references to functions that were [DllImport(\"__Internal\")], due to a mismatch in calling convention. Fixed a bug whereby if you had $\"{too} {many} {fixed} {string} {formatted} {arguments}\" in a string formatter, Burst wouldn't be able to correctly understand how to transform this for the purposes of logging or fixed-string construction. Fixed where Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Constant.IsConstantExpression is evaluated to be later in the compilation pipeline, to let it catch more constant expressions (for instance post-inlining). Rare non zero return code from bcl after successfully building.. Only check assembly cache when the main-thread is requesting some Burst code - meaning that kicking off eager compilation is 1.6x faster than before. stackalloc byte[] with an array initializer was previously only supported when the stackalloc size was 8 or less. Sizes greater than 8 are now supported. Fixed an error that could occur with the form \"System.InvalidOperationException: Could not find burst.initialize function in library 'SomeLibrary'\" Fixed incorrect runtime behavior that could occur when casting a pointer to a generic type Fixed a bug where stackalloc's could be wrongly hoisted out of loops. Added [Preserve] attribute to prevent stripping a compiler service call Fixed incorrect compiler error that could occur when casting a pointer to a generic type and then calling a method with generic parameters Fixed incorrect compiler error that could occur with explicit-layout structs when setting a Size smaller than the natural struct size Added Universal (Apple Silicon + X64) versions of extra build tools Add Android x86_64 and re-enable x86 support Added support for having [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U1)] or [MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.I1)] on a bool external function parameter. Neon intrinsics: Added vst1* experimental APIs Added a global player build setting to let users specify the default optimization choice for Burst. Native support for Apple Silicon. Added support for StructLayoutAttribute.Pack Additional notes about BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer<T> regarding; avoid wrapping in another open generic method, and interoperability with IL2CPP. Removed Removed the Enable Safety Checks option for player builds, since it didn't actually enable safety checks in containers, which are editor only in Unity. Changed Changed how we link object files for iOS and tvOS platforms such that Burst will now create the object file and hand it off to XCode for linking only. Assembly-level attributes (such as [assembly: RegisterGenericJobType]) are now scanned for generic job types to compile Fixed a regression that caused eager-compilation at Editor startup to be slower than it should have been math.f16tof32 now uses hardware intrinsics where available (AVX2 / NEON). half to float or double vector conversions now produce more optimal codegen. Burst Inspector now remembers scroll position between domain reloads Changed how we schedule Burst eager compilation threads. Previously we'd spawn at most 8 of the threads, and only allow 2 to make progress while in the Editor (to ensure the editor UX/UI was as responsive as possible). Instead we now spawn number_of_cores - 1 threads at a lower thread priority, ensuring that any computing power slack can be consumed to speed up Burst compilation. On a 24 core machine this resulted in 2.5x reduction in time taken for Burst to fully compile a large project. Fixed a potential error related to duplicate symbols when calling BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer from inside Burst code Improved performance of checking the cache to see if methods have already been compiled For player builds : lib_burst_generated.txt, pdbs (in non development mode) and dysm folders are now placed into a xxx_BurstDebugInformation_DoNotShip folder alongside the data folder, this is to ensure it is easy to remove the files that you should not ship with your player. Known Issues Code that previously mixed managed or non-readonly static fields with Burst compiled code will now fail to compile. [1.6.0-pre.2] - 2021-04-15 Fixed Fixed obsolete API in package code. [1.6.0-pre.1] - 2021-04-14 Changed Start 1.6 release cycle Changed how we resolve function references in the compiler to improve resolving an existing function reference by 3x. Improve how we handle generic resolution in Cecil to cache the strictly resolved generic types and save a bunch of time in the compiler. Exception strings no longer contain the entry-point name of the job/function-pointer that caused the throw. This change was required because the Burst compiler has to produce deterministic results from any given compile, which is fundamentally opposed to per-entry-point function derivations. Changed how SLEEF global variables for trig functions are pulled into Burst to reduce duplications. Changed how exceptions throw types and messages are stored in our Burst binaries to reduce binary size. Constant array data is now named after the static field it belongs to in assembly Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 11.0.1 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project. The Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.Common.Pause intrinsic is no longer experimental. DOTS Runtime shares the logging code path with the general case Armv8.2 Neon intrinsics are now fully supported Disable threading within the lld linker instances we use for in-editor and desktop cross compilation, because we're already threading seperate process instances of lld and it results in lot of OS context switching. Tweaked how the IL Post Processed 'direct call' Burst function pointers are compiled so that the compilation is deferred until they are needed (previously we'd enqueue them all for compilation on a domain reload). Changed Burst minimum editor version to 2019.4 Use rpmalloc as our native allocator on Windows to speed up concurrently executing LLVM work. When Burst has previously compiled a method, and neither the assembly containing that method nor any of that assembly's dependencies have changed, it was possible after a domain reload for the Mono version of the method to be used for a short time before being replaced by the Burst version. This has now been improved such that the Burst version will be used immediately. Improved iteration speed by reducing the time it takes for Burst to check if any Burst-compilable code has changed Change our link step to not use response files if the command line was smaller enough, saving the cost of the round-trip to the disk. Made half <-> float / double conversions use native hardware where possible (Arm or AVX2 targets). In order to prevent conflicts with the main Unity process, Burst is now inactive in secondary Unity processes, including the asset import worker and out-of-process profiler. This means that in those secondary processes, code that would normally be Burst-compiled will now run under Mono. In a future release of Burst, we hope to lift this restriction and allow Burst-compiled code to run in secondary Unity processes. Fixed Fixed a bug in LLVM that it would incorrectly convert some memset -> memcpy if both pointers derived from the same memory address, and where one indexed into the 0th element of the pointer. Fixed namespace issue triggering a warning in the editor. Made math.shuffle compile correctly when non-constant ShuffleComponent's are used. Fixed alignment issues associated with xxHash3 on ArmV7 (case 1288992) Fixed managed implementation of sub_ss intrinsic Fixed a bug that occurred when an explicitly laid out struct was used by a dup instruction, which caused an internal compiler error. Fixes DOTS Runtime JobProducer Bursting code to support JobProducers with multiple generic arguments, complex job wrapper and generic jobs. Fixed a bug where if a user had defined multiple implicit or explicit casts, the compiler could resolve to the wrong cast. Fixed a bug where explicitly casting from an int to IntPtr would not sign extend the value. String interpolation issues when using Dots / Tiny runtime. Fixed managed implementations of blend_epi32 and mm256_blend_epi32 intrinsics on Mono Fixed a bug where loading from a vector within a struct, that was got from a NativeArray using an indexer, would cause the compiler to crash. Fixed an issue where Burst would erroneously error on BurstCompile.CompileFunctionPointer calls when building for the DOTS Runtime. clang segmentation fault on iOS when member function debug information was emitted, it is disabled for this platform now. Intrinsics: Neon - fixed vget_low and vget_high producing suboptimal code Private [BurstCompile] methods no longer throw MethodAccessException Fixed a bug where the Burst post-processing for direct call would cause duplicate function pointers to be compiled, wasting compile time in the editor and caused an Editor launch stall. Corrected 'Enable safety checks tooltip`. Fixed a minor debug information bug where built-in types with methods (like System.Int32) would generate incorrect debug information. Fixed a very obscure bug where if you had a function-pointer that was called from another function-pointer of job, and that function-pointer happened to be compiled in a player build in the same bucket as the caller, and the no-alias cloning analysis identified that it could clone the original function-pointer to enable more aliasing optimizations, it could create a duplicate symbol error. Revert to internal linkage for Android X86 (32bit) to ensure ABI compliance. Fixed compilation errors when targeting Arm CPUs and using some of the Intel intrinsics Added PreserveAttribute to prevent the internal log from being stripped in il2cpp builds. IL Function Pointer Invoke Transformation updated to handle transforms that affect instructions that are the destination of a branch. IL Function Pointer Invoke Transformation now uses correct runtime library for dots runtime. Fixed compilation errors when targeting Intel CPUs and using some of the Arm Neon intrinsics Fixed a bug where eager-compilation could pick up out-of-date global Burst menu options for compiling. Fixed a bug where the progress bar would report double the amount of pending compile jobs if a user changed the Burst options while background compilation was going on. Fixed some intrinsics not checking target CPU against required CPU, so it was possible to use some intrinsics without an IsXXXSupported check Fixed a bug where having any [DllImport] in a class that used the Direct Call mechanism could result in an illegal CompileFunctionPointer call being produced by our post processor. Fixed an issue where if a user used a math function (like cos, sin, etc) then LLVM would preserve both the scalar and vector implementations even if they were trivially dead, causing us to inject otherwise dead functions into the resulting binary. PDB debug information for instance methods that also used struct return were incorrect. When generating Line Table only debug information, an unreachable could occur due to a missing check. Fixed the 1.5 restriction that Direct Call methods can only be called from the main thread, now they work when called from any thread. Internal Compiler Error if a call was discarded (via BurstDiscard for example), but the callsites required an ABI transform e.g. struct return. Fixed a bug with using multiple IsXXXSupported intrinsics in the same boolean condition would fail. Broken link restored for known issues with debugging and profiling. The Direct Call injected delegate now has a unique suffix to avoid type-name clashes. Dots runtime function pointer transform has been simplified, making it less brittle and fixing some bad IL generation. Fixed crashes on 32 bit windows when calling function pointers from managed code and using IL2CPP. Fixed a possible DivideByZeroException due to race condition in TermInfoDriver initialization code. Fixed a bug where the multi-CPU dispatcher (used for player builds targetting multiple CPU architectures) could end up generating invalid instructions. Gracefully handle failing to find a particular assembly in the ILPP to prevent an ICE. function calls using in modifiers on blittable structs where being treated as non blittable. crash when extracting sequence point information for error reporting/debug information generation. Direct Call extension methods that only differ on argument types are now supported (previously Burst's AssemblyLoader would complain about multiple matches). Fixed a regression where managed static fields, in static constructors that would also be compiled with Burst, could cause a compile time failure for mixing managed and unmanaged state. Added Added links to blog posts from the burst team to the Burst documentation. Intrinsics: Neon - Added support for basic vld1 APIs Can now call BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer() in Burst code Add support for the C# 8.0 construct default(T) is null to Burst by transforming the generated Box + 'is the box non-null?' at compile time. Make it possible to get a pointer to UTF-8 encoded string literal data in HPC# code via StringLiteral.UTF8() Add an OptimizeFor option to [BurstCompile], allowing users to say they want fast code, small code, or fastly compiled code. Known issue with Windows Native Debuggers and Dll numbers + workarounds. Assemblies are now allowed to have an [assembly: BurstCompile()] attribute to let users specify compile options that should apply assembly wide (for instance [assembly: BurstCompile(OptimizeFor = OptimizeFor.FastCompilation)]). Automatically add [UnmanagedFunctionPointer(CallingConvention.Cdecl)] to any delegates that are used for BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer<>() or error if the delegate has the attribute and it is not Cdecl. Source location metadata into hash cache. Added support for having [return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.U1)] or [return: MarshalAs(UnmanagedType.I1)] on a bool return external function. An additional warning about delegates being used by BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer that are not decorated as expected. In most cases, Burst will automatically add the C-declaration attribute in IL Post Processing, but if the usage of CompileFunctionPointer is abstracted away behind an open generic implementation, then Burst will not be able to automatically correct the delegate declaration, and thus this warning will fire. new burst_TargetPlatform_EmbeddedLinux new AotNativeLinkEmbeddedLinux for EmbeddedLinux Added a new OptimizeFor mode Balanced. This becomes the default optimization mode, and trades off slightly lower maximum performance for much faster compile times. Added experimental half precision floating point type f16 Added experimental support for half precision floating point Arm Neon intrinsics Removed Known Issues Direct Call methods only execute using Burst after an initial execution of them on the main-thread. Notes BurstAotCompiler integration done using reflection and raw values, since the platform will only be officially available for 2021.2+ and we special customer versions (shadow branches) for 2019.4 & 2020.3. AotNativeLinkEmbeddedLinux implementation gets the toolchain from environment vars. [1.5.0-pre.2] - 2020-12-01 Added Removed Changed Fixed Fixed a failure on linux builds where libdl.so cannot be found. Known Issues [1.5.0-pre.1] - 2020-11-26 Added New intrinsics Hint.Likely, Hint.Unlikely, and Hint.Assume to let our users tell the compiler some additional information which could aid optimization. New Bmi1 and Bmi2 x86 intrinsics. These are gated on AVX2 being supported to keep the feature sets that Burst has to support small. You can now select explicit x86/x64 architecture SIMD target for Universal Windows Platform. Added Apple silicon and macOS universal binaries support to Burst. An extra alloca hoisting step to ensure that allocas that occur deep within functions are correctly allocated in the function entry block (which LLVM requires for optimization purposes). Added the missing clflush intrinsic to the SSE2 intrinsics. An optimize-for-size option to bcl to let select users focus the optimization passes to create smaller executables. Added a Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.SkipLocalsInitAttribute attribute that lets developers tell the compiler that stack-allocations do not need to be zero initialized for a given function. Added a new attribute [IgnoreWarnings] that can be specified per method, for users that really want the compiler to be quiet. Support for RDMA, crypto, dotprod Armv8.2-A Neon intrinsics An error message if attempting to BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer() on a multicast delegate, since this is not supported in Burst. Burst detects removal of the burst package in 2020.2 editors and beyond, and displays a dialog asking the user to restart the editor. Added a pass that will classify and remove dead loops for improved code generation. Add support for using ValueTuple types like (int, float) from within Burst code, as long as the types do not enter or escape the Burst function boundaries. Added a new intrinsic Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Constant.IsConstantExpression that will return true if an expression is known to be a compile-time constant in Bursted code. Added support for PlayMode / Desktop Standalone Players to load additional burst compiled libraries for use in Modding. Add support for calling Burst code directly from C# without using function pointers. In Unity 2020.2 and above, you can now call new ProfilerMarker(\"MarkerName\") from Burst code Add a compiler error if a ldobj tries to source its address to load from a non-pointer/non-reference. C# frontends should never generate this pattern, but we did see it with code generation. Fixed Fixed an issue where a function with a [return: AssumeRange(13, 42)] could lose this information during inlining. Storing into Lo64 or Hi64 would cause a compiler exception. Hitting a ldobj of a pointer-to-vector would incorrectly load the vector rather than the pointer.Burst only generates unaligned stores. Fix that the parameter to mm256_set1_epi8 should be a byte instead of a char. Fix sqrt_ss would fail because LLVM version later than 6 changed the encoding. Fixed the comi*_ss intrinsics which would generate invalid code. Pdb location for player builds is now linked relative to the final lib_burst_generated.dll, this allows the crashdump utility to access the symbols and provide better callstacks. Support negative intrinsics features checks to enable usage like if (!IsSse41Supported) return;. Clean up linker temp response files on successful build Wasm ABI issue with pointers Pause intrinsic in wasm (ignored) fmod expansion to sleef for wasm The AOT option for disabling optimizations now actually disables optimizations in player builds. Fix a bug where a static readonly variable that was a System.Guid would result in an internal compiler error. bitmask intrinsic was broken on non intel platforms When \"Enable Compilation\" was unchecked in the Burst menu, Burst was incorrectly enabled after an Editor restart. This is now fixed. Fixed a bug where a cloned function (say through no-aliasing propagation cloning) would re-create any global variables used rather than use the original variable. If the only reference to an external function was discarded, don't attempt to add it to the burst initialisation block (which caused on ICE on prior versions). Fixed a case where extracting a FixedString4096 from a parent struct could cause very slow compile times. Fixed a poor error message when a generic unsupported type (like a class or an auto-layout struct) combined with an unsupported managed array (like (int, float)[]) wouldn't give the user any context on where the code went wrong. Fixed a bug where if you used an enum argument to a function to index into a fixed array, a codegen error would occur. If targeting multiple iOS architectures, produce a combined burst library containing all architectures, this fixes \"New Build System\" on xcode version 12. Static method parameters are now validated correctly during eager-compilation Fixed permissions error when running lipo tool to combine libraries. Fixed compiler error that could occur when calling a [BurstDiscard] method with an argument that is also used elsewhere in the method Fixed an issue that could prevent the Editor from shutting down Fixed an internal compiler error when nested managed static readonly arrays were used (produces a proper Burst error instead now). Fixed a bug whereby for platforms that require us to write intermediate LLVM bitcode files, UTF paths would be incorrectly handled. Correctly marked Neon intrinsics vmovn_high_* as ArmV7 and not ArmV8 On windows, the pdb location for burst cached dll's now points to the correct path. Native debuggers attached to the Editor should now locate the symbols without requiring adding the Library/Burst/JitCache folder to the symbol search. Re-enabled BC1370 exception warnings but only for player builds. Fixed a bug whereby if you had an assembly that was guarded by UNITY_SERVER, Burst would be unable to find the assembly when Server Build was ticked. When \"Enable Compilation\" was unchecked in the Burst menu, Burst was incorrectly enabled after an Editor restart. This is now actually fixed. static readonly array with enum elements would cause the compiler to crash. Fixed managed (reference) implementation of mm256_cvttps_epi32 (case 1288563) Debug information for instance methods is now correctly scoped. This means instance variables can now be inspected correctly. Removed Removed support for XCode SDKs less than version 11.0.0. Removed support for platform SDKs that used the older LLVM 6 and 7 in the codebase to significantly simply our code and reduce the package size. Changed Minimum SDK version for iOS/tvOS increased to 13. See https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=03042020b for details. When using \"Executable Only\" build type on Universal Windows Platform, Burst will now only generate code for a single CPU architecture that you're building for. The inliner heuristics have been modified to inline less functions, but improve compile times and reduce executable size. The minimum XCode SDK required to compile for iOS/iPadOS/tvOS is now 11.0.0. We now copy the lib_burst_generated.pdb into the root of the player build (in addition to being alongside the lib_burst_generated.dll), this allows the unity crash handler to resolve the callstacks from burst code. Made Arm Neon intrinsics fully supported (removed the guarding define) Improved eager-compilation performance Improved Burst Inspector loading time Improved Burst initialization time If an argument to a BurstDiscard method is discarded, and that argument is a method call, then a warning is now generated to indicate the function call no longer happens. Changed how struct-return and indirect arguments use stack allocations to significantly reduce stack usage and improve performance in these cases. Improved the compilers ability to deduce dead memory operations (memcpy, memset, etc) to improve performance. Improved error message seen when scheduling Burst compilation during domain reload Open-generic static methods are not supported by Burst, but they were previously visible in Burst Inspector - they are now hidden In Burst Inspector, the \"Safety Checks\" checkbox now defaults to unchecked Burst Inspector no longer loses the search filter and \"Safety Checks\" option after domain reload Changed exception throws to allow more vectorization chances surrounding them. Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 11.0.0 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project. Eager-compilation is now cancelled when script compilation starts, to prevent spurious errors related to recompiled assemblies Strings can now be passed between methods within Burst code. Previously, string literals used for e.g. Debug.Log calls could only appear in the same method where they were used; now the string literal can be in one method, and passed to another method via a string parameter. Transitioning from burst disabled to burst enabled in editor, will perform a re-initialise of some internal state in use by Direct Call methods. Improved the performance of in-compiler hashing by 1.2x. Improved our hashing performance some more by re-using fixed-sized buffers in the compiler to improve eager-compilation / warm-cache costs by 1.25x. Improved compile time by ~37% on big projects by reworking some core compiler infrastructure. Known Issues In player builds, exceptions can report the wrong job that they were thrown from. [1.4.0-preview.4] - 2020-08-17 Fixed Fixed a bug introduced in 1.4.0-preview.3 that prevented some UnityEngine.Debug methods (such as DrawLine) from being called Fixed compiler error when explicit-layout struct contains a field which is itself an empty struct Fixed a bug that if you used more than four arguments in a function declared within another function, and then implicitly captured a few variables, Burst would map the variables wrongly. Changed Bump com.unity.mathematics to 1.2.1 version [1.4.0-preview.3] - 2020-08-06 Added VS 2017 support for platform that needs it. Added first batch of Arm Neon intrinsics. Currently, only ArmV8 (AArch64) targets are supported. The supported intrinsics include all ArmV7 and ArmV8 ones. Removed Changed In versions of Unity older than 2019.3, changing the following options in the Burst menu now requires the Editor to be restarted: Enable Compilation, Safety Checks, and Native Debug Mode Compilation. In versions of Unity older than 2019.3, previously-compiled methods will not be recompiled after changing those options, which could lead to undefined behavior where methods may or may not be compiled with the correct options. This change removes that possibility. Improved performance of \"eager-compilation\" (scheduling compilation immediately after assemblies are changed) by cancelling queued eager-compilation when entering play mode with Synchronous Compilation unchecked Improved performance of eager-compilation by not eager-compiling test assemblies Asserts that are currently discarded no longer discard arguments with potential side effects. Fixed We no longer attempt to replace the debug metadata multiple times for a given export. Fixed a subtle codegen bug that could occur when the target is an Arm or AArch64 CPU with vectors of 3 elements. Inspector slow down when scrolling/moving the window on large listings. Fixed a bug where a stfld into an element of a vector could deduce the wrong type for the underlying vector. Fixed a potential error when running the linker with a failure on lld command. If path to the package contained spaces, then native command execution could fail. This would manifiest as weird errors with 'lld' or 'vswhere' or other native tools. Fixed Debug.Log by re-enabling it when used in function pointers or jobs. Fixed errors when opening Inspector with a non-public Execute method on a job producer type Known Issues [1.4.0-preview.2] - 2020-07-01 Added Removed Changed The Burst Inspector no longer uses JIT compilation. The code it shows is now compiled the same way as for editor / player usage. Warnings are hidden in the inspector view Fixed Fixed potential error that could occur when unloading cached libraries Known Issues [1.4.0-preview.1] - 2020-06-26 Added Experimental support for tvOS Add intrinsics support for AtomicSafetyHandle.NewStaticSafetyId<T> A new option [BurstCompile(DisableSafetyChecks = true)] that allows per job or function-pointer disabling of safety checks. This allows users to have blessed code run fast always. Improve Editor experience by scheduling compilation immediately after assemblies are changed, instead of waiting until Play Mode is entered. Improved our aliasing detection to allow DynamicBuffer structs to be easily vectorizable. Added a compiler warning for any use of throwing an exception from a method not guarded by [Conditional(\"ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS\")]. Since exceptions in Burst are only supported in the editor, this provides a useful warning to users who may be relying on try/catch behaviors for control-flow which is not supported in final game builds. Burst compilation status is now displayed in the Background Tasks window in Unity 2020.1 and above (click the spinner in the bottom-right of the Editor to open this window). Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 10.0.0 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project. Add support for try/finally and using/foreach for IDisposable patterns. Add BurstCompiler.IsEnabled API. Add syntax colouring for LLVM IR and Optimized IR panels in the inspector Removed Changed Made the compiler better at constant-folding complex static readonly constructors. Bursted DOTS Runtime Jobs are now decorated with [NativePInvokeCallback] instead of [MonoPInvokeCallback] which could generate callback wrappers which could cause native code to inadvertently interop with the managed VM. The Burst menu-item Safety Checks has been changed to a modal choice of Off, On, and Force On. Force On will overwrite any user job or function-pointer with DisableSafetyChecks = true. To avoid users falling into the consistent trap of having Safety Checks set to Off, any reload of the Editor will issue a warning telling the user that Safety Checks have been reset to On. Use platform provided memory intrinsics for iOS, tvOS, WASM, and console platforms. Updated Cross Compilation Tooling To LLVM 10 The command line option --burst-disable-compilation is now disabling entirely Burst, including the AppDomain. Fixed Fixed incorrect struct layout for certain configurations of explicit-layout structs with overlapping fields Fixes a caching issue where stale cached libraries may have been used if a project was copied to a different folder, or Unity was upgraded to a newer version Burst will now error if a cpblk was used to copy into a [ReadOnly] parameter or field. Fixed a bug where the mm256_cvtepi32_ps intrinsic would crash the compiler. Fixed a bug with constant expressions that could cause a compile-time hang. Debug symbols are now output when using the native toolchain on mac. Sleef fallback to scalar float for WASM. ABI struct ret/by val for trivial aggregates for WASM is now respected. Fixed a bug with float/double vector constructors of Unity.Mathematics that take half or half vector parameters. Debug information for anonymous structs could be created partially multiple times for the same type. Filter symbol warnings to prevent them reaching logs. Fixed an issue where UNITY_DOTSPLAYER builds not building for NET_DOTS would be unable to compile do to references to UnityEngine. Fixed handling of conversion from signed integer to pointer which caused issues as discovered by Zuntatos on the forums. Allow to call [BurstCompile] functions from other [BurstCompile] functions IntPtr.Size now correctly returns int32 size (rather than UInt64) - fixes an assert. Burst package has been upgraded popup could fire erroneously under shutdown conditions. Fixed an issue preventing player builds to succeed when burst compilation is disabled. Debug symbols for function names on some platforms are no longer hashes. Job Entry point symbols should now reflect the job name and type rather than a hash in callstacks/native profilers Job entry points without symbols now use the Execute location rather than pointing to unknown/unknown Dwarf symbols from multiple modules (e.g. multithreaded AOT compilation) now have correct compilation unit information. Known Issues Output of Debug.Log is temporarily disabled in Burst Function Pointers/Jobs to avoid a deadlock on a domain reload. A fix for the Unity editor is being developed. [1.3.0-preview.12] - 2020-05-05 Fixed Fix an issue when changing the base type of an enum that would not trigger a new compilation and would keep code previously compiled, leading to potential memory corruptions or crashes. Fixed a subtle AArch64 ABI bug with struct-return's (structs that are returned via a pointer argument) that was found by our partners at Arm. Fix an issue that was preventing Debug.Log to be used from a Job in Unity 2020.1 Changed JIT cache is now cleared when changing Burst version [1.3.0-preview.11] - 2020-04-30 Fixed Fix potentially different hashes returned from BurstRuntime.GetHashCode32/64 if called from different assemblies. Fixed an issue where Burst was misidentifying F16C supporting CPUs as AVX2. SDK level bumped for MacOS to ensure notarization requests are compatable. Fixed a typo m256_cvtsi256_si32 -> mm256_cvtsi256_si32 and m256_cvtsi256_si64 -> mm256_cvtsi256_si64. The compiler is now generating a proper compiler error if a managed type used directly or indirectly with SharedStatic . Fixed a bug where implicitly stack allocated variables (var foo = new Foo();) in Burst were not being zero initialized, so any field of the variable that was not initialized during construction would have undefined values. Fix potential race condition when accessing on-disk library cache Fixed a bug where Burst was sometimes producing invalid code for iOS 11.0.3+. Added Added support for System.Threading.Volatile methods Read and Write, and for the System.Threading.Thread.MemoryBarrier method. New FMA X86 intrinsics. These are gated on AVX2 support, as our AVX2 detection requires the AVX2, FMA, and F16C features. UnsafeUtility.MemCmp now maps to a Burst optimal memory comparison path that uses vectorization. Removed Changed Known Issues [1.3.0-preview.10] - 2020-04-21 Fixed Fix negation of integer types smaller than 32 bits. Fixed a bug where optimizer generated calls to ldexp would be incorrectly deduced when deterministic floating-point was enabled. Swapped private linkage for internal linkage on functions, this fixes duplicate symbol issues on some targets. variable scopes should now encompass the whole scope. variables in parent scopes should now be present in locals windows. Native plugin location for windows has changed in 2019.3.9f1. If you are on an older version of 2019.3 you will need to upgrade for burst to work in windows standalone players. Added an error if Assert.AreEqual or Assert.AreNotEqual were called with different typed arguments. Fixed a bug where doing an explicit cast to a Unity.Mathematics vector type where the source was a scalar would fail to compile. Fix issue when converting large unsigned integer values to double or float. Fix an invalid value returned from a conditional where one type is an int32 and the other type would be a byte extended to an int32. Button layout of disassembly toolbar tweaked. Copy to clipboard now copies exactly what is shown in the inspector window (including enhancements and colours if shown) AVX2 now generates the correct AVX2 256-bit wide SLEEF functions instead of the FMA-optimized 128-bit variants. Added Anonymous types are now named in debug information. XCode/LLDB debugging of burst compiled code is now possible on macOS. Added some extra documentation about how to enable AVX/AVX2 in AOT builds, and how we gate some functionality on multiple instruction sets to reduce the combinations exposed underneath. Optimized external functions (like UnsafeUtility.Malloc) such that if they are called multiple times the function-pointer address is cached. Add support for string interpolation (e.g $\"This is a string with an {arg1} and {arg2}\"). Add support for Debug.Log(object) (e.g Debug.Log(\"Hello Log!\");). Add support for string assignment to Unity.Collections.FixedString (e.g \"FixedString128 test = \"Hello FixedString!\"). If burst detects a package update, it now prompts a restart of Unity (via dialog). The restart was always required, but could be missed/forgotten. Better error message for unsupported static readonly arrays. Link to native debugging video to Presentations section of docs. Fixes a bug where in parameters of interfaces could sometimes confuse the Burst inspector. Removed Changed iOS builds for latest xcode versions will now use LLVM version 9. Burst AOT Settings now lets you specify the exact targets you want to compile for - so you could create a player with SSE2, AVX, and AVX2 (EG. without SSE4 support if you choose to). Improve speed of opening Burst Inspector by up to 2x. Provided a better error message when structs with static readonly fields were a mix of managed/unmanaged which Burst doesn't support. Tidied up the known issues section in the docs a little. Enhanced disassembly option has been expanded to allow better control of what is shown, and allow a reduction in the amount of debug metadata shown. Load Burst Inspector asynchronously to avoid locking-up Editor. Documented restrictions on argument and return types for DllImport, internal calls, and function pointers. Known Issues [1.3.0-preview.9] - 2020-04-01 Changed Improved the compile time performance when doing UnsafeUtility.ReadArrayElement or UnsafeUtility.WriteArrayElement with large structs. Made some compile-time improvements when indirect arguments (those whose types are too big that they have to be passed by reference) that reduced our compile time by 3.61% on average. Fixed Fixed a bug where storing a default to a pointer that was generic would cause an LLVM verifier error. Fixed an obscure bug in how struct layouts that had dependencies on each other were resolved. Fixed a bug as found by @iamarugin where LLVM would introduce ldexp/ldexpf during optimizations that LLD would not be able to resolve. Fixed a bug where the compiler would not promote sub-integer types to integers when doing scalar-by-vector math (like multiplies). Added Variable scopes are now constructed for debug information. A new setting to Burst AOT Settings that allows debug symbols to be generated even in a non development standalone build. Removed Known Issues [1.3.0-preview.8] - 2020-03-24 Added Double math builtins in Unity.Mathematics now use double vector implementations from SLEEF. Fixed a bug with lzcnt, tzcnt, and countbits which when called with long types could produce invalid codegen. New F16C X86 intrinsics. These are gated on AVX2 support, as our AVX2 detection requires the AVX2, FMA, and F16C features. Add user documentation about generic jobs and restrictions. Add new experimental compiler intrinsics Loop.ExpectVectorized() and Loop.ExpectNotVectorized() that let users express assumptions about loop vectorization, and have those assumptions validated at compile-time.Enabled with UNITY_BURST_EXPERIMENTAL_LOOP_INTRINSICS. Changed Changed how Unity.Mathematics functions behave during loop vectorization and constant folding to substantially improve code generation. Our SSE4.2 support was implicitly dependent on the POPCNT extended instruction set, but this was not reflected in our CPU identification code. This is now fixed so that SSE4.2 is gated on SSE4.2 and POPCNT support. The popcnt intrinsics now live in their own static class Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.Popcnt to match the new F16C intrinsics. Deferred when we load the SLEEF builtins to where they are actually used, decreasing compile time with Burst by 4.29% on average. Fixed Fix an issue where a generic job instance (e.g MyGenericJob<int>) when used through a generic argument of a method or type would not be detected by the Burst compiler when building a standalone player. [DlIimport(\"__Internal\")] for iOS now handled correctly. Fixes crashes when using native plugins on iOS. Removed Known Issues [1.3.0-preview.7] - 2020-03-16 Added Added additional diagnostic for tracking Visual Studio location failures. Added an override to bypass link.exe discovery under certain conditions. Added a ldloc -> stloc optimization which improves compile times. More documentation on function pointers, specifically some performance considerations to be aware of when using them. Removed Changed Updated tools used for determining Visual Studio locations. Fixed Embedded Portable PDB handling improved. Fixed a case where our load/store optimizer would inadvertently combine a load/store into a cpblk where there were intermediate memory operations that should have been considered. Fixed a bug where the no-alias analysis would, through chains of complicated pointer math, deduce that a no-alias return (like from UnsafeUtility.Malloc) would not alias with itself. No longer log missing MonoPInvokeCallbackAttribute when running tests. Known Issues [1.3.0-preview.6] - 2020-03-12 Added Experimental support for Prefetch, allowing users to request from the memory subsystem pointer addresses they intend to hit next. This functionality is guarded by the UNITY_BURST_EXPERIMENTAL_PREFETCH_INTRINSIC preprocessor define. Fixed Fix SSE maxps intrinsic would emit maxss [1.3.0-preview.5] - 2020-03-11 Fixed MemCpy and MemSet performance regression in Burst 1.3.0.preview.4 (as was spotted by @tertle) has been fixed. Fix a crash when loading assembly with PublicKeyToken starting with a digit. Better handling of MonoPInvokeCallbackAttribute: no check for the namespace, don't print message on Mono builds. Changed Improved error message for typeof usage. [1.3.0-preview.4] - 2020-03-02 Added Debug information for types. Debug information for local variables. Debug information for function parameters. Support for fixed statements. These are useful when interacting with fixed buffers in structs, to get at the pointer data underneath. A fast-math optimization for comparisons that benefits the BurstBenchmarks that nxrightthere has put together. DOTS Runtime Jobs will now generate both MarshalToBurst and MarshalFromBurst functions when job structs in .Net builds are not blittable. DOTS Runtime Job Marshalling generation is now controllable via the commandline switch --generate-job-marshalling-methods. Removed Changed Made it clear that the Burst aliasing intrinsics are tied to optimizations being enabled for a compilation. Restore unwind information for all builds. Print a info message if compiling a function pointer with missing MonoPInvokeCallback attribute (this can lead to runtime issues on IL2CPP with Burst disabled). The message will be converted to a warning in future releases. Fixed Fixed an issue where DOTS Runtime generated job marshalling functiosn may throw a FieldAccessException when scheduling private and internal job structs. Fix a bug that prevented entry point method names (and their declaring type names) from having a leading underscore. vector/array/pointer debug data now utilizes the correct size information. DOTS Runtime will now only generate job marshaling functions on Windows, as all other platforms rely on Mono which does not require job marshalling. ldobj / stobj of large structs being copied to stack-allocated variables could cause compile-time explosions that appeared to the user like the compiler had hung. Worked around these by turning them into memcpy's underneath in LLVM. Don't always use latest tool chain on certain platforms. Fix a crash when compiling job or function pointer that was previously cached, then unloaded, then reloaded. Fixed compiler error in array element access when index type is not Int32. Fix set1_xxx style x86 intrinsics generated compile time errors. Known Issues Native debugger feature is only available on windows host platform at the moment. [1.3.0-preview.3] - 2020-02-12 Changed Changed how the inliner chooses to inline functions to give the compiler much more say over inlining decisions based on heuristics. Updated AOT requirements to be clearer about cross platform support. Added 1.3.0-preview.1 added support for desktop cross compilation, but the changelog forgot to mention it. Removed Fixed Documentation for the command line options to unity contained extra - Burst now exclusively uses the <project>/Temp/Burst folder for any temporary files it requires during compilation. Fix a regression that could break usage of native plugins. Known Issues [1.3.0-preview.2] - 2020-02-10 Fixed Fix the error Burst failed to compile the function pointer Int32 DoGetCSRTrampoline() that could happen when loading a project using Burst with Burst disabled. [1.3.0-preview.1] - 2020-02-04 Added Enabled lower precision variants for pow, sin, cos, log, log2, log10, exp, exp2, and exp10 when BurstPrecision.Low is specified. Add CPU minimum and maximum target for desktop platforms Standalone Player builds. Append a newline between IRPassDiagnostic messages, fixes pass diagnostics readability in the inspector. Add a new attribute [AssumeRange] that lets users tag function parameters and returns of an integer type with a constrained range that the value is allowed to inhabit. NativeArray.Length and NativeSlice.Length have automatic detection that the property is always positive. This assumption feeds into the optimizer and can produce better codegen. Enabled support for DOTS Runtime SharedStatics. Due to the nature of DOTS Runtime, only the generic versions of SharedStatic.GetOrCreate<TContext> are supported. Add a new intrinsic Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.Common.Pause() which causes a thread pause to occur for the current thread. This is useful for spin-locks to stop over contention on the lock. Add some new Burst aliasing deductions to substantially improve the aliasing detection in the compiler, resulting in better codegen. Add syntax colouring to WASM. Add IsCreated to the FunctionPointer class to allow checks on whether a given function pointer has a valid (non null) pointer within it.

Added support for Interlocked.Read. Added a new intrinsic Common.umul128 which lets you get the low and high components of a 64-bit multiplication. This is especially useful for things like large hash creation. Menu option to allow all burst jobs to be more easily debugged in a native debugger. Removed Changed Upgraded Burst to use LLVM Version 9.0.1 by default, bringing the latest optimization improvements from the LLVM project. Upgraded Burst to use SLEEF 3.4.1, bringing the latest performance improvements to mathematics functions as used in Burst. Improved Burst performance in the Editor by caching compiled libraries on-disk, meaning that in subsequent runs of the Editor, assemblies that haven't changed won't be recompiled. Update the documentation of CompileSynchronously to advise against any general use of setting CompileSynchronously = true. Take the Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Aliasing intrinsics out of experimental. These intrinsics form part of our strategy to give users more insight into how the compiler understands their code, by producing compiler errors when user expectations are not met. Questions like 'Does A alias with B?' can now be definitively answered for developers. See the Aliasing Checks section of the Burst documentation for information. Align disassembly instruction output in Inspector (x86/x64 only). Renamed m128 to v128. Renamed m256 to v256. BurstCompile(Debug=true), now modifies the burst code generator (reducing some optimisations) in order to allow a better experience in debugging in a native debugger.

    "keywords": "Aliasing and the job system Unity's job system infrastructure has some limitations on what can alias within a job struct: Structs attributed with [NativeContainer] (for example, NativeArray and NativeSlice) that are members of a job struct don't alias. Job struct members with the [NativeDisableContainerSafetyRestriction] attribute can alias with other members. This is because this attribute explicitly opts in to this kind of aliasing. Pointers to structs attributed with [NativeContainer] can't appear in other structs attributed with [NativeContainer]. For example, you can't have a NativeArray<NativeSlice<T>>. The following example job shows how these limitations work in practice: [BurstCompile] private struct MyJob : IJob { public NativeArray<float> a; public NativeArray<float> b; public NativeSlice<int> c; [NativeDisableContainerSafetyRestriction] public NativeArray<byte> d; public void Execute() { ... } } a, b, and c don't alias with each other. d can alias with a, b, or c. Tip If you're used to working with C/C++'s Type Based Alias Analysis (TBAA), then you might assume that because d has a different type from a, b, or c, it shouldn't alias. However, in C#, pointers don't have any assumptions that pointing to a different type results in no aliasing. This is why d is assumed to alias with a, b, or c."

    "keywords": "NoAlias attribute Use the [NoAlias] attribute to give Burst additional information on the aliasing of pointers and structs. In most use cases, you won't need to use the [NoAlias] attribute. You don't need to use it with [NativeContainer] attributed structs, or with fields in job structs. This is because the Burst compiler infers the no-alias information. The [NoAlias] attribute is exposed so that you can construct complex data structures where Burst can't infer the aliasing. If you use the [NoAlias] attribute on a pointer that could alias with another, it might result in undefined behavior and make it hard to track down bugs. You can use this attribute in the following ways: On a function parameter it signifies that the parameter doesn't alias with any other parameter to the function. On a struct field it signifies that the field doesn't alias with any other [NoAlias] field of the struct. On a struct it signifies that the address of the struct can't appear within the struct itself. On a function return value it signifies that the returned pointer doesn't alias with any other pointer returned from the same function. NoAlias function parameter The following is an example of aliasing: int Foo(ref int a, ref int b) { b = 13; a = 42; return b; } For this, Burst produces the following assembly: mov dword ptr [rdx], 13 mov dword ptr [rcx], 42 mov eax, dword ptr [rdx] ret This means that Burst does the following: Stores 13 into b. Stores 42 into a. Reloads the value from b to return it. Burst has to reload b because it doesn't know whether a and b are backed by the same memory or not. Add the [NoAlias] attribute to the code to change this: int Foo([NoAlias] ref int a, ref int b) { b = 13; a = 42; return b; } For this, Burst produces the following assembly: mov dword ptr [rdx], 13 mov dword ptr [rcx], 42 mov eax, 13 ret In this case, the load from b has been replaced with moving the constant 13 into the return register. NoAlias struct field The following example is the same as the previous, but applied to a struct: struct Bar { public NativeArray<int> a; public NativeArray<float> b; } int Foo(ref Bar bar) { bar.b[0] = 42.0f; bar.a[0] = 13; return (int)bar.b[0]; } For this, Burst produces the following assembly: mov rax, qword ptr [rcx + 16] mov dword ptr [rax], 1109917696 mov rcx, qword ptr [rcx] mov dword ptr [rcx], 13 cvttss2si eax, dword ptr [rax] ret In this case, Burst does the following: Loads the address of the data in b into rax. Stores 42 into it (1109917696 is 0x42280000, which is 42.0f). Loads the address of the data in a into rcx. Stores 13 into it. Reloads the data in b and converts it to an integer for returning. If you know that the two NativeArrays aren't backed by the same memory, you can change the code to the following: struct Bar { [NoAlias] public NativeArray<int> a; [NoAlias] public NativeArray<float> b; } int Foo(ref Bar bar) { bar.b[0] = 42.0f; bar.a[0] = 13; return (int)bar.b[0]; } If you attribute both a and b with [NoAlias] it tells Burst that they don't alias with each other within the struct, which produces the following assembly: mov rax, qword ptr [rcx + 16] mov dword ptr [rax], 1109917696 mov rax, qword ptr [rcx] mov dword ptr [rax], 13 mov eax, 42 ret This means that Burst can return the integer constant 42. NoAlias struct Burst assumes that the pointer to a struct doesn't appear within the struct itself. However, there are cases where this isn't true: unsafe struct CircularList { public CircularList* next; public CircularList() { // The 'empty' list just points to itself. next = this; } } Lists are one of the few structures where it's normal to have the pointer to the struct accessible from somewhere within the struct itself. The following example indicates where [NoAlias] on a struct can help: unsafe struct Bar { public int i; public void* p; } float Foo(ref Bar bar) { *(int*)bar.p = 42; return ((float*)bar.p)[bar.i]; } This produces the following assembly: mov rax, qword ptr [rcx + 8] mov dword ptr [rax], 42 mov rax, qword ptr [rcx + 8] mov ecx, dword ptr [rcx] movss xmm0, dword ptr [rax + 4*rcx] ret In this case, Burst: Loads p into rax. Stores 42 into p. Loads p into rax again. Loads i into ecx. Returns the index into p by i. In this situation, Burst loads p twice. This is because it doesn't know if p points to the address of the struct bar. Once it stores 42 into p it has to reload the address of p from bar, which is a costly operation. Add [NoAlias] to prevent this: [NoAlias] unsafe struct Bar { public int i; public void* p; } float Foo(ref Bar bar) { *(int*)bar.p = 42; return ((float*)bar.p)[bar.i]; } This produces the following assembly: mov rax, qword ptr [rcx + 8] mov dword ptr [rax], 42 mov ecx, dword ptr [rcx] movss xmm0, dword ptr [rax + 4*rcx] ret In this situation, Burst only loads the address of p once, because [NoAlias] tells it that p can't be the pointer to bar. NoAlias function return Some functions can only return a unique pointer. For instance, malloc only returns a unique pointer. In this case, [return:NoAlias] gives some useful information to Burst. Important Only use [return: NoAlias] on functions that are guaranteed to produce a unique pointer. For example, with bump-allocations, or with things like malloc. Burst aggressively inlines functions for performance considerations, so with small functions, Burst inlines them into their parents to produce the same result without the attribute. The following example uses a bump allocator backed with a stack allocation: // Only ever returns a unique address into the stackalloc'ed memory. // We've made this no-inline because Burst will always try and inline // small functions like these, which would defeat the purpose of this // example [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)] unsafe int* BumpAlloc(int* alloca) { int location = alloca[0]++; return alloca + location; } unsafe int Func() { int* alloca = stackalloc int[128]; // Store our size at the start of the alloca. alloca[0] = 1; int* ptr1 = BumpAlloc(alloca); int* ptr2 = BumpAlloc(alloca); *ptr1 = 42; *ptr2 = 13; return *ptr1; } This produces the following assembly: push rsi push rdi push rbx sub rsp, 544 lea rcx, [rsp + 36] movabs rax, offset memset mov r8d, 508 xor edx, edx call rax mov dword ptr [rsp + 32], 1 movabs rbx, offset \"BumpAlloc(int* alloca)\" lea rsi, [rsp + 32] mov rcx, rsi call rbx mov rdi, rax mov rcx, rsi call rbx mov dword ptr [rdi], 42 mov dword ptr [rax], 13 mov eax, dword ptr [rdi] add rsp, 544 pop rbx pop rdi pop rsi ret The key things that Burst does: Has ptr1 in rdi. Has ptr2 in rax. Stores 42 into ptr1. Stores 13 into ptr2. Loads ptr1 again to return it. If you add the [return: NoAlias] attribute: [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)] [return: NoAlias] unsafe int* BumpAlloc(int* alloca) { int location = alloca[0]++; return alloca + location; } unsafe int Func() { int* alloca = stackalloc int[128]; // Store our size at the start of the alloca. alloca[0] = 1; int* ptr1 = BumpAlloc(alloca); int* ptr2 = BumpAlloc(alloca); *ptr1 = 42; *ptr2 = 13; return *ptr1; } It produces the following assembly: push rsi push rdi push rbx sub rsp, 544 lea rcx, [rsp + 36] movabs rax, offset memset mov r8d, 508 xor edx, edx call rax mov dword ptr [rsp + 32], 1 movabs rbx, offset \"BumpAlloc(int* alloca)\" lea rsi, [rsp + 32] mov rcx, rsi call rbx mov rdi, rax mov rcx, rsi call rbx mov dword ptr [rdi], 42 mov dword ptr [rax], 13 mov eax, 42 add rsp, 544 pop rbx pop rdi pop rsi ret In this case, Burst doesn't reload ptr2, and moves 42 into the return register."

    "title": "Memory aliasing | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Memory aliasing Memory aliasing is a way to tell Burst how your code uses data. This can improve and optimize the performance of your application. Memory aliasing happens when locations in the memory overlap each other. The following documentation outlines the difference between memory aliasing, and no memory aliasing. The following example shows a job that copies data from an input array to an output array: [BurstCompile] private struct CopyJob : IJob { [ReadOnly] public NativeArray<float> Input; [WriteOnly] public NativeArray<float> Output; public void Execute() { for (int i = 0; i < Input.Length; i++) { Output[i] = Input[i]; } } } No memory aliasing If the arrays Input and Output don't overlap, which means that their respective memory location doesn't overlap, the code returns the following result after running this job on a sample input/output: Memory with no aliasing If Burst is noalias aware, it can work at the scalar level to optimize the previous scalar loop. It does this through a process called vectorizing, where it rewrites the loop to process elements in a small batch. For example, Burst could work at vector level in 4 by 4 elements: Memory with no aliasing vectorized Memory aliasing If the Output array overlaps the Input array by one element (for example Output[0] points to Input[1]), then this means that the memory is aliasing. This gives the following result when you run CopyJob without the auto vectorizer: Memory with aliasing If Burst isn't aware of the memory aliasing, it tries to auto vectorize the loop, which results in the following: Memory with aliasing and invalid vectorized code The result of this code is invalid and might lead to bugs if Burst can't identify them. Generated code In the CopyJob example, there is an x64 assembly targeted at AVX2 in its loop. The instruction vmovups moves 8 floats, so a single auto vectorized loop moves 4 × 8 floats, which equals 32 floats copied per loop iteration, instead of just one: .LBB0_4: vmovups ymm0, ymmword ptr [rcx - 96] vmovups ymm1, ymmword ptr [rcx - 64] vmovups ymm2, ymmword ptr [rcx - 32] vmovups ymm3, ymmword ptr [rcx] vmovups ymmword ptr [rdx - 96], ymm0 vmovups ymmword ptr [rdx - 64], ymm1 vmovups ymmword ptr [rdx - 32], ymm2 vmovups ymmword ptr [rdx], ymm3 sub rdx, -128 sub rcx, -128 add rsi, -32 jne .LBB0_4 test r10d, r10d je .LBB0_8 The following example shows the same Burst compiled loop, but Burst's aliasing is artificially disabled: .LBB0_2: mov r8, qword ptr [rcx] mov rdx, qword ptr [rcx + 16] cdqe mov edx, dword ptr [rdx + 4*rax] mov dword ptr [r8 + 4*rax], edx inc eax cmp eax, dword ptr [rcx + 8] jl .LBB0_2 The result is entirely scalar and runs approximately 32 times slower than the highly optimized, vectorized variant that the original alias analysis produces. Function cloning For function calls where Burst knows about the aliasing between parameters to the function, Burst can infer the aliasing. It can then propagate this onto the called function to improve optimization: [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)] int Bar(ref int a, ref int b) { a = 42; b = 13; return a; } int Foo() { var a = 53; var b = -2; return Bar(ref a, ref b); } The assembly for Bar would be: mov dword ptr [rcx], 42 mov dword ptr [rdx], 13 mov eax, dword ptr [rcx] ret This is because Burst doesn't know the aliasing of a and b within the Bar function. This is in line with what other compiler technologies do with this code snippet. Burst is smarter than this though. Through a process of function cloning, Burst creates a copy of Bar where it knows that the aliasing properties of a and b don't alias. It then replaces the original call to Bar with a call to the copy. This results in the following assembly: mov dword ptr [rcx], 42 mov dword ptr [rdx], 13 mov eax, 42 ret In this scenario, Burst doesn't perform the second load from a. Aliasing checks Because aliasing is key to Burst's ability to optimize for performance, there are some aliasing intrinsics: Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Aliasing.ExpectAliased expects that the two pointers do alias, and generates a compiler error if not. Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Aliasing.ExpectNotAliased expects that the two pointers don't alias, and generates a compiler error if not. An example: using static Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Aliasing; [BurstCompile] private struct CopyJob : IJob { [ReadOnly] public NativeArray<float> Input; [WriteOnly] public NativeArray<float> Output; public unsafe void Execute() { // NativeContainer attributed structs (like NativeArray) cannot alias with each other in a job struct! ExpectNotAliased(Input.getUnsafePtr(), Output.getUnsafePtr()); // NativeContainer structs cannot appear in other NativeContainer structs. ExpectNotAliased(in Input, in Output); ExpectNotAliased(in Input, Input.getUnsafePtr()); ExpectNotAliased(in Input, Output.getUnsafePtr()); ExpectNotAliased(in Output, Input.getUnsafePtr()); ExpectNotAliased(in Output, Output.getUnsafePtr()); // But things definitely alias with themselves! ExpectAliased(in Input, in Input); ExpectAliased(Input.getUnsafePtr(), Input.getUnsafePtr()); ExpectAliased(in Output, in Output); ExpectAliased(Output.getUnsafePtr(), Output.getUnsafePtr()); } } These checks only run when optimizations are enabled, because proper aliasing deduction is intrinsically linked to the optimizer's ability to see through functions via inlining."

For example, if you want to compile X64_SSE2 and X64_SSE4, the Burst has to do two separate compilations to generate code for each of the targets you choose. To keep the combinations of targets to a minimum, Burst target platforms require multiple processor instruction sets underneath: SSE4.2 is gated on having SSE4.2 and POPCNT instruction sets. AVX2 is gated on having AVX2, FMA, F16C, BMI1, and BMI2 instruction sets. ARMV8A is a basic Armv8-A CPU target ARMV8A_HALFFP is ARMV8A plus the following extensions: fullfp16, dotprod, crypto, crc, rdm, lse. In practice, this means Cortex A75/A55 and later cores. ARMV9A is ARMV8A_HALFFP plus SVE2 support. In practice, this means Cortex X2/A710/A510 and later cores. Important: this target is currently experimental. Dynamic dispatch based on runtime CPU features For all x86/x64 CPU desktop platforms, as well as for 64-bit Arm on Android, Burst takes into account the CPU features available at runtime to dispatch jobs to different versions it compiles. For x86 and x64 CPUs, Burst supports SSE2 and SSE4 instruction sets at runtime only. For example, with dynamic CPU dispatch, if your CPU supports SSE3 and below, Burst selects SSE2 automatically."

It also means that other assemblies compile as they did before, which gives you more control on how Burst works with your code. Assembly-level BurstCompile attributes iterate with any job or function-pointer attribute, and also with any globally set options from the Burst Editor menu.

FloatMode.Fast: Burst can perform instruction re-arrangement and use dedicated or less precise hardware SIMD instructions. FloatMode.Deterministic: Unsupported. Deterministic mode is reserved for a future iteration of Burst.

    "keywords": "Generic jobs Burst compiles a job in two ways: In the Editor, it compiles the job when it's scheduled, known as just-in-time (JIT) compilation. In a player build, it compiles the job as part of the built player, known as ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation. For more information, see the documentation on Compilation. If the job is a concrete type (doesn't use generics), Burst compiles it in both modes (AOT and JIT). However, a generic job might behave in an unexpected way. While Burst supports generics, it has limited support for generic jobs or function pointers. If you notice that a job scheduled in the Editor is running at full speed, but not in a built player, it's might be a problem related to generic jobs. The following example defines a generic job: // Direct generic job [BurstCompile] struct MyGenericJob<TData> : IJob where TData : struct { public void Execute() { ... } } You can also nest generic jobs: // Nested generic job public class MyGenericSystem<TData> where TData : struct { [BurstCompile] struct MyGenericJob : IJob { public void Execute() { ... } } public void Run() { var myJob = new MyGenericJob(); // implicitly MyGenericSystem<TData>.MyGenericJob myJob.Schedule(); } } Jobs that aren't Burst compiled look like this: // Direct Generic Job var myJob = new MyGenericJob<int>(); myJob.Schedule(); // Nested Generic Job var myJobSystem = new MyGenericSystem<float>(); myJobSystem.Run(); In both cases, in a player build, the Burst compiler detects that it has to compile MyGenericJob<int> and MyGenericJob<float>. This is because the generic jobs (or the type surrounding it for the nested job) are used with fully resolved generic arguments (int and float). However, if these jobs are used indirectly through a generic parameter, the Burst compiler can't detect the jobs it has to compile at player build time: public static void GenericJobSchedule<TData>() where TData: struct { // Generic argument: Generic Parameter TData // This Job won't be detected by the Burst Compiler at standalone-player build time. var job = new MyGenericJob<TData>(); job.Schedule(); } // The implicit MyGenericJob<int> will run at Editor time in full Burst speed // but won't be detected at standalone-player build time. GenericJobSchedule<int>(); The same restriction applies if you declare the job in the context of generic parameter that comes from a type: // Generic Parameter TData public class SuperJobSystem<TData> { // Generic argument: Generic Parameter TData // This Job won't be detected by the Burst Compiler at standalone-player build time. public MyGenericJob<TData> MyJob; } If you want to use generic jobs, you must use them directly with fully resolved generic arguments (for example, int, MyOtherStruct). You can't use them with a generic parameter indirection (for example, MyGenericJob<TContext>). Important Burst doesn't support scheduling generic Jobs through generic methods. Function pointers Function pointers are restricted because you can't use a generic delegate through a function pointer with Burst: public delegate void MyGenericDelegate<T>(ref TData data) where TData: struct; var myGenericDelegate = new MyGenericDelegate<int>(MyIntDelegateImpl); // Will fail to compile this function pointer. var myGenericFunctionPointer = BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer<MyGenericDelegate<int>>(myGenericDelegate); This limitation is because of a limitation of the .NET runtime to interop with such delegates. For more information, see the documentation on Function pointers."

When you build and run your application to a player, Burst compiles ahead-of-time (AOT). Just-in-time compilation While your application is in Play mode in the Editor, Burst compiles your code asynchronously at the point that Unity uses it. This means that your code runs under the default Mono compiler until Burst completes its work in the background. To force Unity to compile your code synchronously while in the Editor, see Synchronous compilation Ahead-of-time compilation When you build your project, Burst compiles all the supported code ahead-of-time (AOT) into a native library which Unity ships with your application. To control how Burst compiles AOT, use the Player Settings window. Depending on the platform you want to build for, AOT compilation might require access to linker tools.

    "title": "Synchronous compilation | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Synchronous compilation By default, when in Play mode, the Burst compiler compiles jobs asynchronously. To force synchronous compilation, set the CompileSynchronously property to true, which compiles your method on the first schedule. [BurstCompile(CompileSynchronously = true)] public struct MyJob : IJob { // ... } If you don't set this property, on the first call of a job, Burst compiles it asynchronously in the background, and runs a managed C# job in the mean time. This minimizes any frame hitching and keeps the experience responsive. However, when you set CompileSynchronously = true, no asynchronous compilation can happen. This means that it might take longer for Burst to compile. This pause for compilation affects the current running frame, which means that hitches can happen and it might provide an unresponsive experience for users. In general, only use CompileSynchronously = true in the following situations: If you have a long running job that only runs once. The performance of the compiled code might outweigh the downsides doing the compilation synchronously. If you're profiling a Burst job and want to test the code from the Burst compiler. When you do this, perform a warmup to discard any timing measurements from the first call to the job. This is because the profiling data includes the compilation time and skews the result. To aid with debugging the difference between managed and Burst compiled code."

    "title": "Compilation warnings | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Compilation warnings This page describes common compilation warnings, and how to fix them. IgnoreWarning attribute The Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.IgnoreWarningAttribute attribute lets you suppress warnings for a specific function that is being compiled from Burst. However, the warnings that the Burst compiler generates are very important to pay attention to, so this attribute should be used sparingly and only when necessary. The sections below describe the specific situations in which you might want to suppress warnings. BC1370 Warning BC1370 produces the message: An exception was thrown from a function without the correct [Conditional(\"ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS\")] guard... This warning happens if Unity encounters a throw in code that [Conditional(\"ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS\")] doesn't guard. In the Editor, thrown exceptions will be caught and logged to the Console, but in a Player build, a throw becomes an abort, which crashes your application. Burst warns you about these exceptions, and advises you to place them in functions guarded with [Conditional(\"ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS\")], because functions guarded with that attribute will not be included in Player builds. However, if you want to purposely throw an exception to crash your application, use the IgnoreWarningAttribute to suppress the warnings that Burst provides on the throw: [IgnoreWarning(1370)] int DoSomethingMaybe(int x) { if (x < 0) throw new Exception(\"Dang - sorry I crashed your game!\"); return x * x; } Note This warning is only produced for exceptions that persist into Player builds. Editor-only or debug-only exception throws that aren't compiled into Player builds will not trigger this warning. BC1371 Warning BC1371 produces the message: A call to the method 'xxx' has been discarded, due to its use as an argument to a discarded method... To understand this warning, consider the following example: [BurstDiscard] static void DoSomeManagedStuff(int x) { ///.. only run when Burst compilation is disabled } // A function that computes some result which we need to pass to managed code int BurstCompiledCode(int x,int y) { return y+2*x; } [BurstCompile] void BurstMethod() { var myValue = BurstCompiledCode(1,3); DoSomeManagedStuff(myValue); } When Unity compiles your C# code in release mode, it optimizes and removes the local variable myValue. This means that Burst receives something like the following code : [BurstCompile] void BurstedMethod() { DoSomeManagedStuff(BurstCompiledCode(1,3)); } This makes Burst generate the warning, because Burst discards DoSomeManagedStuff, along with the BurstCompiledCode argument. This means that the BurstCompiledCode function is no longer executed, which generates the warning. If this isn't what you intended then ensure the variable has multiple uses. For example: void IsUsed(ref int x) { // Dummy function to prevent removal } [BurstCompile] void BurstedMethod() { var myValue = BurstCompiledCode(1,3); DoSomeManagedStuff(myValue); IsUsed(ref myValue); } Alternatively, if you're happy that the code is being discarded correctly, ignore the warning on the BurstedMethod like so: [IgnoreWarning(1371)] [BurstCompile] void BurstMethod() { var myValue = BurstCompiledCode(1,3); DoSomeManagedStuff(myValue); }"

    "keywords": "Processor specific SIMD extensions Burst exposes all Intel SIMD intrinsics from SSE up to and including AVX2 in the Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86 family of nested classes. The Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.Arm.Neon class provides intrinsics for Arm Neon's Armv7, Armv8, and Armv8.2 (RDMA, crypto, dotprod). Organizing your code You should statically import these intrinsics because they contain plain static functions: using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86.Sse; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86.Sse2; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86.Sse3; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86.Ssse3; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86.Sse4_1; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86.Sse4_2; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86.Popcnt; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86.Avx; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86.Avx2; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86.Fma; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86.F16C; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86.Bmi1; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.X86.Bmi2; using static Unity.Burst.Intrinsics.Arm.Neon; Burst CPU intrinsics are translated into specific CPU instructions. However, Burst has a special compiler pass which makes sure that your CPU target set in Burst AOT Settings is compatible with the intrinsics used in your code. This ensures you don't try to call unsupported instructions (for example, AArch64 Neon on an Intel CPU or AVX2 instructions on an SSE4 CPU), which causes the process to abort with an \"Invalid instruction\" exception. A compiler error is generated if the check fails. However, if you want to provide several code paths with different CPU targets, or to make sure your intrinsics code is compatible with any target CPU, you can wrap your intrinsics code with the followinf property checks: IsNeonSupported IsNeonArmv82FeaturesSupported IsNeonCryptoSupported IsNeonDotProdSupported IsNeonRDMASupported For example: if (IsAvx2Supported) { // Code path for AVX2 instructions } else if (IsSse42Supported) { // Code path for SSE4.2 instructions } else if (IsNeonArmv82FeaturesSupported) { // Code path for Armv8.2 Neon instructions } else if (IsNeonSupported) { // Code path for Arm Neon instructions } else { // Fallback path for everything else } These branches don't affect performance. Burst evaluates the IsXXXSupported properties at compile-time and eliminates unsupported branches as dead code, while the active branch stays there without the if check. Later feature levels implicitly include the previous ones, so you should organize tests from most recent to oldest. Burst emits compile-time errors if you've used intrinsics that aren't part of the current compilation target. Burst doesn't bracket these with a feature level test, which helps you to narrow in on what to put inside a feature test. If you run your application in .NET, Mono or IL2CPP without Burst enabled, all the IsXXXSupported properties return false. However, if you skip the test you can still run a reference version of most intrinsics in Mono (exceptions listed below), which is helpful if you need to use the managed debugger. Reference implementations are slow and only intended for managed debugging. Important There isn't a reference managed implementation of Arm Neon intrinsics. This means that you can't use the technique mentioned in the previous paragraph to step through the intrinsics in Mono. FMA intrinsics that operate on doubles don't have a software fallback because of the inherit complexity in emulating fused 64-bit floating point math. Intrinsics use the types v64 (Arm only), v128 and v256, which represent a 64-bit, 128-bit or 256-bit vector respectively. For example, given a NativeArray<float> and a Lut lookup table of v128 shuffle masks, a code fragment like this performs lane left packing, demonstrating the use of vector load/store reinterpretation and direct intrinsic calls: v128 a = Input.ReinterpretLoad<v128>(i); v128 mask = cmplt_ps(a, Limit); int m = movemask_ps(a); v128 packed = shuffle_epi8(a, Lut[m]); Output.ReinterpretStore(outputIndex, packed); outputIndex += popcnt_u32((uint)m); Intel intrinsics The Intel intrinsics API mirrors the C/C++ Intel instrinsics API, with a the following differences: All 128-bit vector types (__m128, __m128i and __m128d) are collapsed into v128 All 256-bit vector types (__m256, __m256i and __m256d) are collapsed into v256 All _mm prefixes on instructions and macros are dropped, because C# has namespaces All bitfield constants (for example, rounding mode selection) are replaced with C# bitflag enum values Arm Neon intrinsics The Arm Neon intrinsics API mirrors the Arm C Language Extensions, with the following differences: All vector types are collapsed into v64 and v128, becoming typeless. This means that the vector type must contain expected element types and count when calling an API. The *x2, *x3, *x4 vector types aren't supported. poly* types aren't supported. reinterpret* functions aren't supported (they aren't needed because of the usage of v64 and v128 vector types). Intrinsic usage is only supported on Armv8 (64-bit) hardware. Burst's CPU intrinsics use typeless vectors. Because of this, Burst doesn't perform any type checks. For example, if you call an intrinsic which processes 4 ints on a vector that was initialized with 4 floats, then there's no compiler error. The vector types have fields that represent every element type, in a union-like struct, which gives you flexibility to use these intrinsics in a way that best fits your code. Arm Neon C intrinsics (ACLE) use typed vectors, for example int32x4_t, and has special APIs (for example, reinterpret_\\*) to convert to a vector of another element type. Burst CPU intrinsics vectors are typeless, so these APIs are not needed. The following APIs provide the equivalent functionality: v64 (Arm Neon only) v128 v256 For a categorized index of Arm Neon intrinsics supported in Burst, see the Arm Neon intrinsics reference."

Calling generic methods or methods whose declaring type is generic isn't supported, otherwise the rules as for function pointers apply. However, you don't need to worry about the extra boiler plate needed for function pointers. The following example shows a Burst-compiled utility class. Because it uses structs, it passes by reference per the function pointer rules. [BurstCompile] public static class MyBurstUtilityClass { [BurstCompile] public static void BurstCompiled_MultiplyAdd(in float4 mula, in float4 mulb, in float4 add, out float4 result) { result = mula * mulb + add; } } Use this method from managed code like so: public class MyMonoBehaviour : MonoBehaviour { void Start() { var mula = new float4(1, 2, 3, 4); var mulb = new float4(-1,1,-1,1); var add = new float4(99,0,0,0); MyBurstUtilityClass.BurstCompiled_MultiplyAdd(mula, mulb, add, out var result); Debug.Log(result); } } If you attach this script to an object and run it, float4(98f, 2f, -3f, 4f) is printed to the log.

    "keywords": "Function pointers To work with dynamic functions that process data based on other data states, use FunctionPointer<T>. Because Burst treats delegates as managed objects, you can't use C# delegates to work with dynamic functions. Support details Function pointers don't support generic delegates. Also, avoid wrapping BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer<T> within another open generic method. If you do this, Burst can't apply required attributes to the delegate, perform additional safety analysis, or perform potential optimizations. Argument and return types are subject to the same restrictions as DllImport and internal calls. For more information, see the documentation on DllImport and internal calls. Interoperability with IL2CPP Interoperability of function pointers with IL2CPP requires System.Runtime.InteropServices.UnmanagedFunctionPointerAttribute on the delegate. Set the calling convention to CallingConvention.Cdecl. Burst automatically adds this attribute to delegates that are used with BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer<T>. Using function pointers To use function pointers, identify the static functions that you want Burst to compile and do the following: Add a [BurstCompile] attribute to these functions Add a [BurstCompile] attribute to the containing type. This helps the Burst compiler find the static methods that have [BurstCompile] attribute Declare a delegate to create the \"interface\" of these functions Add a [MonoPInvokeCallbackAttribute] attribute to the functions. You need to add this so that IL2CPP works with these functions. For example: // Instruct Burst to look for static methods with [BurstCompile] attribute [BurstCompile] class EnclosingType { [BurstCompile] [MonoPInvokeCallback(typeof(Process2FloatsDelegate))] public static float MultiplyFloat(float a, float b) => a * b; [BurstCompile] [MonoPInvokeCallback(typeof(Process2FloatsDelegate))] public static float AddFloat(float a, float b) => a + b; // A common interface for both MultiplyFloat and AddFloat methods public delegate float Process2FloatsDelegate(float a, float b); } Compile these function pointers from regular C# code: // Contains a compiled version of MultiplyFloat with Burst FunctionPointer<Process2FloatsDelegate> mulFunctionPointer = BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer<Process2FloatsDelegate>(MultiplyFloat); // Contains a compiled version of AddFloat with Burst FunctionPointer<Process2FloatsDelegate> addFunctionPointer = BurstCompiler. CompileFunctionPointer<Process2FloatsDelegate>(AddFloat); Using function pointers in a job To use the function pointers directly from a job, pass them to the job struct: // Invoke the function pointers from HPC# jobs var resultMul = mulFunctionPointer.Invoke(1.0f, 2.0f); var resultAdd = addFunctionPointer.Invoke(1.0f, 2.0f); Burst compiles function pointers asynchronously for jobs by default. To force a synchronous compilation of function pointers use [BurstCompile(SynchronousCompilation = true)]. Using function pointers in C# code To use these function pointers from regular C# code, cache the FunctionPointer<T>.Invoke property (which is the delegate instance) to a static field to get the best performance: private readonly static Process2FloatsDelegate mulFunctionPointerInvoke = BurstCompiler.CompileFunctionPointer<Process2FloatsDelegate>(MultiplyFloat).Invoke; // Invoke the delegate from C# var resultMul = mulFunctionPointerInvoke(1.0f, 2.0f); Using Burst-compiled function pointers from C# might be slower than their pure C# version counterparts if the function is too small compared to the overhead of P/Invoke interop. Performance considerations Where possible, you use a job over a function pointer to run Burst compiled code, because jobs are more optimal. Burst provides better aliasing calculations for jobs because the job safety system has more optimizations by default. You also can't pass most of the [NativeContainer] structs like NativeArray directly to function pointers and must use a job struct to do so. Native container structs contain managed objects for safety checks that the Burst compiler can work around when compiling jobs, but not for function pointers. The following example shows a bad example of how to use function pointers in Burst. The function pointer computes math.sqrt from an input pointer and stores it to an output pointer. MyJob feeds this function pointer sources from two NativeArrays which isn't optimal: ///Bad function pointer example [BurstCompile] public class MyFunctionPointers { public unsafe delegate void MyFunctionPointerDelegate(float* input, float* output); [BurstCompile] public static unsafe void MyFunctionPointer(float* input, float* output) { *output = math.sqrt(*input); } } [BurstCompile] struct MyJob : IJobParallelFor { public FunctionPointer<MyFunctionPointers.MyFunctionPointerDelegate> FunctionPointer; [ReadOnly] public NativeArray<float> Input; [WriteOnly] public NativeArray<float> Output; public unsafe void Execute(int index) { var inputPtr = (float*)Input.GetUnsafeReadOnlyPtr(); var outputPtr = (float*)Output.GetUnsafePtr(); FunctionPointer.Invoke(inputPtr + index, outputPtr + index); } } This example isn't optimal for the following reasons: Burst can't vectorize the function pointer because it's being fed a single scalar element. This means that 4-8x performance is lost from a lack of vectorization. The MyJob knows that the Input and Output native arrays can't alias, but this information isn't communicated to the function pointer. There is a non-zero overhead to constantly branching to a function pointer somewhere else in memory. To use a function pointer in an optimal way, always process batches of data in the function pointer, like so: [BurstCompile] public class MyFunctionPointers { public unsafe delegate void MyFunctionPointerDelegate(int count, float* input, float* output); [BurstCompile] public static unsafe void MyFunctionPointer(int count, float* input, float* output) { for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) { output[i] = math.sqrt(input[i]); } } } [BurstCompile] struct MyJob : IJobParallelForBatch { public FunctionPointer<MyFunctionPointers.MyFunctionPointerDelegate> FunctionPointer; [ReadOnly] public NativeArray<float> Input; [WriteOnly] public NativeArray<float> Output; public unsafe void Execute(int index, int count) { var inputPtr = (float*)Input.GetUnsafeReadOnlyPtr() + index; var outputPtr = (float*)Output.GetUnsafePtr() + index; FunctionPointer.Invoke(count, inputPtr, outputPtr); } } Thee modified MyFunctionPointer takes a count of elements to process, and loops over the input and output pointers to do a lot of calculations. The MyJob becomes an IJobParallelForBatch, and the count is passed directly into the function pointer. This is better for performance because of the following reasons: Burst vectorizes the MyFunctionPointer call. Because Burst processes count items per function pointer, any overhead of calling the function pointer is reduced by count times. For example, if you run a batch of 128, the function pointer overhead is 1/128th per index of what it was previously. Batching results in a 1.53x performance gain over not batching. However, to get the best possible performance, use a job. This gives Burst the most visibility over what you want it to do, and the most opportunities to optimize: [BurstCompile] struct MyJob : IJobParallelFor { [ReadOnly] public NativeArray<float> Input; [WriteOnly] public NativeArray<float> Output; public unsafe void Execute(int index) { Output[i] = math.sqrt(Input[i]); } } This runs 1.26x faster than the batched function pointer example, and 1.93x faster than the non-batched function pointer examples. Burst has perfect aliasing knowledge and can make the broadest modifications to the above. This code is also a lot simpler than either of the function pointer cases."

If an exception happens in Burst, the behavior is different from .NET. In .NET, if an exception occurs inside a try block, control flow goes to the finally block. However, in Burst, if an exception happens inside or outside a try block, the exception throws as if any finally blocks do not exist.

Burst also provides alternatives for some C# constructions not directly accessible to HPC#: Function pointers as an alternative to using delegates within HPC# Shared static to access static mutable data from both C# and HPC# Exception expressions Burst supports throw expressions for exceptions. Exceptions thrown in the editor can be caught by managed code, and are reported in the console window. Exceptions thrown in player builds will always cause the application to abort. Thus with Burst you should only use exceptions for exceptional behavior. To ensure that code doesn't end up relying on exceptions for things like general control flow, Burst produces the following warning on code that tries to throw within a method not attributed with [Conditional(\"ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS\")]: Burst warning BC1370: An exception was thrown from a function without the correct [Conditional(\"ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS\")] guard. Exceptions only work in the editor and so should be protected by this guard Foreach and While Burst supports invoking foreach and while. However, there is an edge case which is currently unsupported - methods that take one or more generic collection parameters T: IEnumerable<U> and invoke foreach or while on at least one of the collections in the method body. To illustrate, the following example methods exemplify this limitation: public static void IterateThroughConcreteCollection(NativeArray<int> list) { foreach (var element in list) { // This works } } public static void IterateThroughGenericCollection<S>(S list) where S : struct, IEnumerable<int> { foreach (var element in list) { // This doesn't work } } Note that the uppermost method IterateThroughConcreteCollection()'s parameter is specified to be a concrete collection type, in this case NativeArray<int>. Because it's concrete iterating through it inside the method will compile in Burst. In the method IterateThroughGenericCollection() below it, however, the parameter is specified to be a generic collection type S. Iterating through S inside the method will therefore not compile in Burst. It will instead throw the following error: Can't call the method (method name) on the generic interface object type (object name). This may be because you are trying to do a foreach over a generic collection of type IEnumerable.

To do this, create a key for both the containing type (for example, MutableStaticTest in the example above), identify the field (for example, IntFieldKey class in the example above) and pass these classes as generic arguments of SharedStatic<int>.GetOrCreate<MutableStaticTest, IntFieldKey>(). Always initialize the shared static field in C# from a static constructor before accessing it from HPC#. If you don't initialize the data before accessing it, it might lead to an undefined initialization state."

    "keywords": "Static read-only fields and static constructor support Burst evaluates all static fields and all static constructors at compile time. It evaluates all the static fields and the static constructors for a given struct together. When there is a static field that isn't read-only in a Burst-compiled struct, a compilation error happens. This is because Burst only supports read-only static fields. When Burst fails to evaluate any static field or static constructor, all fields and constructors fail for that struct. When compile-time evaluation fails, Burst falls back to compiling all static initialization code into an initialization function that it calls once at runtime. This means that your code needs to be Burst compatible, or it will fail compilation if it fails compile-time evaluation. An exception to this is that there's limited support for initializing static read-only array fields as long as they're initialized from either an array constructor or from static data: static readonly int[] MyArray0 = { 1, 2, 3, .. }; static readonly int[] MyArray1 = new int[10]; Language support Burst doesn't support calling external functions and function pointers.

The System.Runtime.CompilerServices attributes [CallerLineNumber], [CallerMemberName], and [CallerFilePath] on arguments to Burst functions. However, you can only pass the strings directly to calls to Debug.Log. A string can be either: A string literal. For example: \"This is a string literal\". An interpolated string using $\"This is an integer {value} or using string.Format, where the string to format is also a string literal. For example, Burst supports the following constructions: Logging with a string literal: Debug.Log(\"This a string literal\"); Logging using string interpolation: int value = 256; Debug.Log($\"This is an integer value {value}\"); This is the same as using string.Format directly: int value = 256; Debug.Log(string.Format(\"This is an integer value {0}\", value)); Supported Debug.Log methods Burst supports the following Debug.Log methods: Debug.Log(object) Debug.LogWarning(object) Debug.LogError(object) String interpolation support String interpolation has the following restrictions: The string must be a string literal Burst supports the following string.Format methods: string.Format(string, object) string.Format(string, object, object) string.Format(string, object, object, object) string.Format(string, object[]). Use this for a string interpolation that contains more than three arguments, for example $\"{arg1} {arg2} {arg3} {arg4} {arg5}\". In this case, the object[] array needs to be a constant size and no arguments should involve control flows (for example, $\"This is a {(cond ? arg1 : arg2)}\"). The string must only use value types The string must take only built-in type arguments: char boolean byte / sbyte double float short / ushort int / uint long / ulong Burst supports sll vector types (for example int2, float3), except half vector types. For example: var value = new float3(1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f); // Logs \"This value float3(1f, 2f, 3f)\" Debug.Log($\"This value `{value}`\"); Burst doesn't support ToString() of structs. It displays the full name of the struct instead. For more information, see the .NET documentation on String interpolation and Standard numeric format strings. Managed strings You can pass a managed string literal or an interpolated string directly to Debug.Log, but you can't pass a string to a user method or to use them as fields in a struct. To pass around or store strings, use one of the FixedString structs in the Unity.Collections package: int value = 256; FixedString128 text = $\"This is an integer value {value} used with FixedString128\"; MyCustomLog(text); // ... // String can be passed as an argument to a method using a FixedString, // but not using directly a managed `string`: public static void MyCustomLog(in FixedString128 log) { Debug.Log(text); } Arguments and specifiers Burst has limited support for string format arguments and specifiers: int value = 256; // Padding left: \"This value ` 256` Debug.Log($\"This value `{value,5}`\"); // Padding right: \"This value `256 ` Debug.Log($\"This value `{value,-5}`\"); // Hexadecimal uppercase: \"This value `00FF` Debug.Log($\"This value `{value:X4}`\"); // Hexadecimal lowercase: \"This value `00ff` Debug.Log($\"This value `{value:x4}`\"); // Decimal with leading-zero: \"This value `0256` Debug.Log($\"This value `{value:D4}`\");"

Make sure that the source location of the interlocked methods are naturally aligned. For example, the alignment of the pointer is a multiple of the pointed-to-type: [StructLayout(LayoutKind.Explicit)] struct Foo { [FieldOffset(0)] public long a; [FieldOffset(5)] public long b; public long AtomicReadAndAdd() { return Interlocked.Read(ref a) + Interlocked.Read(ref b); } } If the pointer to the struct Foo has an alignment of 8, which is the natural alignment of a long value, the Interlocked.Read of a would be successful because it lies on a naturally aligned address.

The following sections gives more details about the constructs that Burst supports, and any limitations they have. Built-in types Array types Struct types Generic types Vector types Enum types Pointer types Span types Tuple types Built-in types Supported built-in types Burst supports the following built-in types: bool byte/sbyte double float int/uint long/ulong short/ushort Unsupported built-in types Burst doesn't support the following built-in types: char decimal string because this is a managed type Array types Supported array types Burst supports read-only managed arrays loaded from static read-only fields: [BurstCompile] public struct MyJob : IJob { private static readonly int[] _preComputeTable = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 }; public int Index { get; set; } public void Execute() { int x = _preComputeTable[0]; int z = _preComputeTable[Index]; } } However, accessing a static read-only managed array has the following restrictions: You can only use the read-only static managed array directly and can't pass it around, for example as a method argument. C# code that doesn't use jobs shouldn't modify the read-only static array's elements. This is because the Burst compiler makes a read-only copy of the data at compilation time. Multi-dimensional arrays aren't supported. If you've used an unsupported static constructor, Burst produces the error BC1361. For more information on how Burst initializes arrays, see Static readonly fields and static constructors. Unsupported array types Burst doesn't support managed arrays. Instead, use a native container such as NativeArray . Struct types Supported structs Burst supports the following structs: Regular structs with any field with supported types Structs with fixed array fields Note Structs with an explicit layout might generate non-optimal native code. Supported struct layout Burst supports the following struct layouts: LayoutKind.Sequential LayoutKind.Explicit StructLayoutAttribute.Pack StructLayoutAttribute.Size Burst supports System.IntPtr and System.UIntPtr natively as intrinsic structs that directly represent pointers. Generic types Burst supports generic types used with structs. It supports full instantiation of generic calls for generic types that have interface constraints, for example when a struct with a generic parameter needs to implement an interface. Note There are restrictions if you use generic jobs. Vector types Burst can translate vector types from Unity.Mathematics to native SIMD vector types with the following first class support for optimizations: bool2/bool3/bool4 uint2/uint3/uint4 int2/int3/int4 float2/float3/float4 Tip For performance reasons, use the 4 wide types (bool4, uint4, float4, int4, ) over the other types. Enum types Supported enum types Burst supports all enums including enums that have a specific storage type, for example, public enum MyEnum : short. Unsupported enums Burst doesn't support Enum methods, for example Enum.HasFlag. Pointer types Burst supports any pointer types to any Burst supported types Span types Burst supports Span<T> and ReadOnlySpan<T> types in the Unity Editors that support them. You can only use span types in Burst jobs or function-pointers, but not across the interface to them. This is because in C#'s implementation of the span types it supports taking spans into managed data types (like a managed array). For example, the following code is invalid: [BurstCompile] public static void SomeFunctionPointer(Span<int> span) {} This is because Span is used across the managed and Burst boundary. In Burst, span types respect any safety check setting, and only perform performance-intensive checks when safety checks are enabled. Tuple types Burst supports value tuples ValueTuple<T1,T2> in Burst-compiled jobs or static methods, but not across the interface to them. This is because value tuples are of struct layout LayoutKind.Auto. Burst does not support LayoutKind.Auto (to see a list of struct layouts Burst supports see the section Struct types). However, one can use a regular struct to emulate a tuple like so: [BurstCompile] private struct MyTuple { public int item1; public float item2; }"

    "keywords": "Debugging and profiling tools The following sections describe how to debug and profile your Burst-compiled code in the Editor and in player builds. Tip Before attempting to debug Burst-compiled code, enable script debugging for the Editor, or a player build by following the steps in Debug C# code in Unity. Although you can theoretically debug Burst-compiled code even when the script compilation mode is set to Release, in practice it doesn't work reliably. Breakpoints might be skipped, and variables might not appear in the Locals window, for example. Debugging Burst-compiled code in the Editor To debug Burst-compiled code in the Editor, you can either use a managed debugger, or a native debugger. This section explains both options. Attach a managed debugger You can attach a managed debugger such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac, or JetBrains Rider. This is the same type of debugger you can use to debug regular managed C# code in your Unity project. The ways of attaching a debugger differ depending on the version of Unity you're using: Unity 2022.2+: When you place a breakpoint inside Burst-compiled code, and you have a managed debugger attached, Unity disables Burst automatically for that code path. This allows you to use a managed debugger to debug the managed version of your code. When you remove all breakpoints from that code path, Unity re-enables Burst for that code path. Unity 2022.1 and older: Disable Burst, either with the global option in the Editor Burst menu (Jobs > Burst > Enable Compilation), or comment out the [BurstCompile] attribute from the specific entry-point that you want to debug. Attach a native debugger You can attach a native debugger such as Visual Studio or Xcode. Before doing so, you need to disable Burst optimizations. You can do this in the following ways: Use the Native Debug Mode Compilation setting in the Editor Burst menu (Jobs > Burst > Native Debug Mode Compilation). Important: This setting disables optimizations across all jobs, which impacts the performance of Burst code. If you want to disable optimizations only for a specific job, use the other option in this list. Add the Debug = true flag to your job, which disables optimizations and enables debugging on that specific job: [BurstCompile(Debug = true)] public struct MyJob : IJob { // ... } Tip Player builds pick up the Debug flag, so you can also use this to debug a player build. To attach a native debugger to the Unity Editor process, see the native debugging section below. Debugging Burst-compiled code in a player build Because of the way that Unity builds the code for a player, you need to tell the debugging tool where to find the symbols. To do this, point the tool to the folder that contains the lib_burst_generated files, which is usually in the Plugins folder. To debug Burst-compiled code in a player build, you need to attach a native debugger (such as Visual Studio or Xcode) to the player process. Before doing so, you need to: Enable symbol generation. You can do this in either of two ways: Enable the Development Build option before you build the player, or Enable the Force Debug Information option in Burst AOT Player Settings Disable Burst optimizations. You can do this in either of two ways: Disable the Enable Optimizations option in Burst AOT Player Settings. Important: This setting disables optimizations across all jobs, which impacts the performance of Burst code. If you want to disable optimizations only for a specific job, use the other option in this list. Add the Debug = true flag to your job, which disables optimizations and enables debugging on that specific job: [BurstCompile(Debug = true)] public struct MyJob : IJob { // ... } To attach a native debugger to the player process, see the native debugging section below. Native debugging Follow the instructions above to setup native debugging correctly for the Editor or a player build. Then, attach a native debugger such as Visual Studio or Xcode. Native debugging limitations Native debuggers can't discover lambda captures on Entity.ForEach, so you can't inspect variables originating from these. Structs that use [StructLayout(LayoutKind=Explicit)] and have overlapping fields are represented by a struct that hides one of the overlaps. Types that are nested, are namespaced in C/C++ style. e.g. namespace Pillow { public struct Spot { public struct SubSpot { public int a; public int b; } public int a; public int b; public SubSpot sub; } You would refer to SubSpot as Pillow::Spot::SubSpot in this case (for instance if you were trying to cast a pointer in a debugger watch window). Code-based breakpoints Burst supports code-based breakpoints through the System.Diagnostics.Debugger.Break method. This method generates a debug trap in your code. You must attach a debugger to your code so that it can intercept the break. Breakpoints trigger whether you've attached a debugger or not. Burst adds information to track local variables, function parameters and breakpoints. If your debugger supports conditional breakpoints, use these over adding breakpoints in your code, because they only fire when you've attached a debugger. Profiling Burst-compiled code Profiling using standalone profiling tools You can use profiling tools (such as Instruments or Superluminal) to profile Burst-compiled code in a player build. Because of the way that Unity builds the code for a player, you need to tell the profiling tool where to find the symbols. To do this, point the tool to the folder that contains the lib_burst_generated files, which is usually in the Plugins folder. Unity Profiler markers To improve the data you get from Unity Profiler (either for Burst-compiled code running in the Editor or in an attached player), you can create Unity Profiler markers from Burst code by calling new ProfilerMarker(\"MarkerName\"): [BurstCompile] private static class ProfilerMarkerWrapper { private static readonly ProfilerMarker StaticMarker = new ProfilerMarker(\"TestStaticBurst\"); [BurstCompile(CompileSynchronously = true)] public static int CreateAndUseProfilerMarker(int start) { using (StaticMarker.Auto()) { var p = new ProfilerMarker(\"TestBurst\"); p.Begin(); var result = 0; for (var i = start; i < start + 100000; i++) { result += i; } p.End(); return result; } } }"

To open the Burst Inspector window, go to Jobs > Burst > Open Inspector. The Burst Inspector displays all the Jobs that it can compile. It also displays the generated intermediate and native assembly code. When opening a new target job in the Burst Inspector, it will try to focus the assembly directly related to the chosen bursted job. Furthermore, if branch flow arrows are shown, and they fill more than half of the assembly view, the inspector will scroll horizontally rightwards to focus the code instead of the branches. Burst Inspector with Branch Flow enabled Burst Inspector panes The Compile Targets pane on the left of the window displays an alphabetical list of the jobs in the project that Burst can compile. By default jobs either in the Unity namespace or with \".Generated\" in the name are excluded. This can be changed via the toggles Show Unity Namespace and Show \".Generated\" respectively. Disabled jobs in the list don't have the [BurstCompile] attribute. The right output pane of the Burst Inspector window displays options to view the assembly and intermediate code for the job you've selected in the Compile Targets list. To expand or collapse elements of the code, select the colored boxes (some with ellipses) . By default. the Burst Inspector automatically collapses blocks that it considers non-essential, such as most directives and data. It is possible to select lines of assembly. This will highlight the selected line, by underlining it. If this line contains any registers, the usage of these registers will be highlighted throughout the code; note that implicit registers are ignored for this feature. To select and copy the text in this pane, either click and drag with your mouse, or use Shift + arrow keys to select the text. To copy the text, either right-click and select Copy Selection, or press Ctrl + C (Command + C on macOS). Default behavior for the Burst Inspector's copy is to include underlying color tags. To change this, right-click with the mouse on the right pane, to open up the context menu, and untick Copy Color Tags. At the top of the window, the following display options are available: Display option Function Output dropdown Use the dropdown to select how to output the information in the Burst Inspector window Plain Without Debug Information Displays the raw output. Plain With Debug Information Displays the raw output with debug information. Enhanced with Minimal Debug Information (Only available in Assembly view) Displays the line information interweaved with the assembly to guide you to what line in your code matches what assembly output. If you've enabled Show Branch Flow, the branch flow indicates where jump instruction might branch off to. Enhanced With Full Debug Information (Only available in Assembly view) Displays the same information as Enhanced with Minimal Debug Information but with debug information included. Coloured With Minimal Debug Information (Only available in Assembly view) Displays the same information as Enhanced with Minimal Debug Information, but displays the output in color. Coloured With Full Debug Information (Only available in Assembly view) Displays the same information as Enhanced with Full Debug Information, but displays the output in color. Safety Checks Enable this option to generate code that includes container access safety checks, for example, to check if a job is attempting to write to a read-only native container. Font Size Select the size of the text in the output pane. Architecture dropdown Select the target architecture for your build. Focus on Code (Only available in Enhanced or Coloured output) Collapses the least important blocks of the disassembly. When you select this, Unity hides most of the assembly language directives and non code segments, allowing you to focus on the code itself. Expand all (Only available in Enhanced or Coloured output) Expands all collapsed blocks of disassembly and displays all the hidden assembly language directives and data elements. Show Branch Flow (Only available in Enhanced or Coloured output) Enable this option to display arrows that show branch flow in the code. When enabled, the code moves to the right, to make space to display the arrows. Highlight SIMD Scalar vs Packed (Only available in Enhanced or Coloured output) Enable this option to display SIMD instruction differently depending on their nature (Whether they work on packed or scalar inputs). This can be used to quickly assess the quality of the generated vectorized code (see SIMD smell test by Andreas Fredriksson). Assembly Displays the final optimized native code that Burst generated. .NET IL Displays the original .NET IL extracted from the job method. LLVM IR (Unoptimized) Displays the internal LLVM IR before optimizations. LLVM IR (Optimized) Displays the internal LLVM IR after optimizations.

The following settings are available: Setting Function Enable Compilation Enable this setting to activate Burst compilation. When you enable this setting, Burst compiles jobs and Burst custom delegates that you tag with the attribute [BurstCompile]. Enable Safety Checks Choose what safety checks Burst should use. For more information see the Enable Safety Checks setting section of this documentation. Off Disable safety checks across all Burst jobs and function-pointers. Only use this setting if you want more realistic profiling results from in-Editor captures. When you reload the Editor, this setting always resets to On. On Enable safety checks on code that uses collection containers (e.g NativeArray<T>). Checks include job data dependency and container indexes out of bounds. This is the default setting. Force On Force safety checks on even for jobs and function-pointers that have DisableSafetyChecks = true. Use this setting to rule out any problems that safety checks might have caught. Synchronous Compilation Enable this setting to compile Burst synchronously. For more information, see Synchronous compilation. Native Debug Mode Compilation Enable this setting to deactivate optimizations on all code that Burst compiles. This makes it easier to debug via a native debugger. For more information, see Native Debugging tools. Show Timings Enable this setting to log the time it takes to JIT compile a job in the Editor and display it in the Console. For more information see the Show Timings setting section of this documentation. Open Inspector Opens the Burst Inspector window. Enable Safety Checks setting To disable Burst's safety check code, use DisableSafetyChecks. This results in faster code generation, however make sure that you use containers in a safe fashion. To disable safety checks on a job or function-pointer set DisableSafetyChecks to true: [BurstCompile(DisableSafetyChecks = true)] public struct MyJob : IJob { // ... } Burst ignores code marked explicitly with DisableSafetyChecks = true when it safety checks your code if you set Enable Safety Checks to On in the Editor. Select Force On to make Burst to safety check all code, including code marked with DisableSafetyChecks = true. Show Timings setting When you enable the Show Timings setting, Unity logs an output in the Console window for each library of entry points that Burst compiles. Burst batches the compilation into units of methods-per-assembly, and groups multiple entry-points together in a single compilation task. This output is useful if you want to report outliers in compilation to the Burst compiler team (via the Burst forum). Unity splits Burst's output into the following major sections: Method discovery (where Burst works out what it needs to compile) Front end (where Burst turns C# IL into an LLVM IR module) Middle end (where Burst specializes, optimizes, and cleans up the module) Back-end (where Burst turns the LLVM IR module into a native DLL) The compile time in the front end and optimizer is linear to the amount operations that it needs to compile. More functions and more instructions means a longer compile time. The more generic functions you have, the higher the front end performance timings, because generic resolutions have non-zero costs. The compile time in the back-end scales with the number of entry-points in the module. This is because each entry point is in its own native object file. If the optimizer takes a significant amount of time, use [BurstCompile(OptimizeFor = OptimizeFor.FastCompilation)] which reduces the optimizations that Burst does, but compiles things much faster. Profile the job before and after to make sure that this tradeoff is right for that entry-point."

Modding manager The following is an example of a modding manager: using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.IO; using System.Reflection; using UnityEngine; using Unity.Burst; public class PluginManager : MonoBehaviour { public bool modsEnabled; public GameObject objectForPlugins; List<PluginModule> plugins; void Start() { plugins = new List<PluginModule>(); // If mods are disabled, early out - this allows us to disable mods, enter Play Mode, exit Play Mode //and be sure that the managed assemblies have been unloaded (assuming DomainReload occurs) if (!modsEnabled) return; var folder = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(Application.dataPath, \"..\", \"Mods\")); if (Directory.Exists(folder)) { var mods = Directory.GetDirectories(folder); foreach (var mod in mods) { var modName = Path.GetFileName(mod); var monoAssembly = Path.Combine(mod, $\"{modName}_managed.dll\"); if (File.Exists(monoAssembly)) { var managedPlugin = Assembly.LoadFile(monoAssembly); var pluginModule = managedPlugin.GetType(\"MyPluginModule\"); var plugin = Activator.CreateInstance(pluginModule) as PluginModule; plugins.Add(plugin); } var burstedAssembly = Path.Combine(mod, $\"{modName}_win_x86_64.dll\"); // Burst dll (assuming windows 64bit) if (File.Exists(burstedAssembly)) { BurstRuntime.LoadAdditionalLibrary(burstedAssembly); } } } foreach (var plugin in plugins) { plugin.Startup(objectForPlugins); } } // Update is called once per frame void Update() { foreach (var plugin in plugins) { plugin.Update(objectForPlugins); } } } This code scans the \"Mods\" folder, and for each folder it finds within, it attempts to load both a managed dll and a Burst compiled dll. It does this by adding them to an internal list that it can then iterate on and call the respective interface functions. The names of the files are arbitrary: see Simple Create Mod Menu Button, which is the code that generated those files. Because this code loads the managed assemblies into the current domain, you need a domain reload to unload those before you can overwrite them. Unity automatically unloads the Burst dll files automatically unloaded when you exit Play mode. This is why a Boolean to disable the modding system is included, for testing in the Editor. A mod that uses Burst Create a separate Unity project for this to use the project to produce the mod. The following script attaches to a UI Canvas that contains a text component called Main UI Label, and changes the text when the mod is used. The text is either Plugin Updated : Bursted or Plugin Updated : Not Bursted. You will see the Plugin Updated : Bursted by default, but if you comment out the lines that load the Burst library in the PluginManager above, then the Burst compiled code doesn't load and the message changes appropriately. using Unity.Burst; using Unity.Collections; using Unity.Jobs; using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.UI; public class MyPluginModule : PluginModule { Text textComponent; public void Startup(GameObject gameObject) { var childTextComponents = gameObject.GetComponentsInChildren<Text>(); textComponent = null; foreach (var child in childTextComponents) { if (child.name == \"Main UI Label\") { textComponent = child; } } if (textComponent==null) { Debug.LogError(\"something went wrong and i couldn't find the UI component i wanted to modify\"); } } public void Update(GameObject gameObject) { if (textComponent != null) { var t = new CheckBurstedJob { flag = new NativeArray<int>(1, Allocator.TempJob, NativeArrayOptions.UninitializedMemory) }; t.Run(); if (t.flag[0] == 0) textComponent.text = \"Plugin Updated : Not Bursted\"; else textComponent.text = \"Plugin Updated : Bursted\"; t.flag.Dispose(); } } [BurstCompile] struct CheckBurstedJob : IJob { public NativeArray<int> flag; [BurstDiscard] void CheckBurst() { flag[0] = 0; } public void Execute() { flag[0] = 1; CheckBurst(); } } } Put the above script in a folder along with an assembly definition file with an assembly name of TestMod_Managed, so that the next script can locate the managed part. Simple Create Mod Menu button The below script adds a menu button. When you use the menu button, it builds a Standalone Player, then copies the C# managed dll and the lib_burst_generated.dll into a chosen Mod folder. This example assumes you are using Windows. using UnityEditor; using System.IO; using UnityEngine; public class ScriptBatch { [MenuItem(\"Modding/Build X64 Mod (Example)\")] public static void BuildGame() { string modName = \"TestMod\"; string projectFolder = Path.Combine(Application.dataPath, \"..\"); string buildFolder = Path.Combine(projectFolder, \"PluginTemp\"); // Get filename. string path = EditorUtility.SaveFolderPanel(\"Choose Final Mod Location\", \"\", \"\"); FileUtil.DeleteFileOrDirectory(buildFolder); Directory.CreateDirectory(buildFolder); // Build player. var report = BuildPipeline.BuildPlayer(new[] { \"Assets/Scenes/SampleScene.unity\" }, Path.Combine(buildFolder, $\"{modName}.exe\"), BuildTarget.StandaloneWindows64, BuildOptions.Development); if (report.summary.result == UnityEditor.Build.Reporting.BuildResult.Succeeded) { // Copy Managed library var managedDest = Path.Combine(path, $\"{modName}_Managed.dll\"); var managedSrc = Path.Combine(buildFolder, $\"{modName}_Data/Managed/{modName}_Managed.dll\"); FileUtil.DeleteFileOrDirectory(managedDest); if (!File.Exists(managedDest)) // Managed side not unloaded FileUtil.CopyFileOrDirectory(managedSrc, managedDest); else Debug.LogWarning($\"Couldn't update manged dll, {managedDest} is it currently in use?\"); // Copy Burst library var burstedDest = Path.Combine(path, $\"{modName}_win_x86_64.dll\"); var burstedSrc = Path.Combine(buildFolder, $\"{modName}_Data/Plugins/x86_64/lib_burst_generated.dll\"); FileUtil.DeleteFileOrDirectory(burstedDest); if (!File.Exists(burstedDest)) FileUtil.CopyFileOrDirectory(burstedSrc, burstedDest); else Debug.LogWarning($\"Couldn't update bursted dll, {burstedDest} is it currently in use?\"); } } }"

    "keywords": "AssumeRange attribute Use the AssumeRange attribute to tell Burst that a given scalar-integer lies within a certain constrained range. If Burst has this information, it can improve the performance of your application. The following code is an example of this: [return:AssumeRange(0u, 13u)] static uint WithConstrainedRange([AssumeRange(0, 26)] int x) { return (uint)x / 2u; } This example tells Burst the following: The variable x is in the closed-interval range [0..26], or more plainly that x >= 0 && x <= 26. The return value from WithConstrainedRange is in the closed-interval range [0..13], or more plainly that x >= 0 && x <= 13. Burst uses these assumptions to create better code generation. However, there are some restrictions: You can only place these on scalar-integer (signed or unsigned) types. The type of the range arguments must match the type being attributed. Burst has deductions for the .Length property of NativeArray and NativeSlice which indicates that these always return non-negative integers: static bool IsLengthNegative(NativeArray<float> na) { // Burst always replaces this with the constant false return na.Length < 0; } For example, if you have a container like the following: struct MyContainer { public int Length; // Some other data... } The following example shows how to tell Burst that Length is always a positive integer: struct MyContainer { private int _length; [return: AssumeRange(0, int.MaxValue)] private int LengthGetter() { return _length; } public int Length { get => LengthGetter(); set => _length = value; } // Some other data... }"

You can use it for optimizations for a known constant value. For example, if you want to implement a pow-like function for integer powers: using static Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Constant; public static float MyAwesomePow(float f, int i) { if (IsConstantExpression(i) && (2 == i)) { return f * f; } else { return math.pow(f, (float)i); } } The IsConstantExpression check means that Burst always removes the branch if i isn't constant, because the if condition is false. This means that if i is constant and is equal to 2, you can use a more optimal simple multiply instead. The result of IsConstantExpression intentionally depends on the result of the optimizations being run. Therefore the result can change based on whether a function gets inlined or not. For example in the case above: IsConstantExpression(i) is false on its own, because i is a function argument which is obivously not constant. However, if MyAwesomePow gets inlined with a constant value for i, then it will evaluate to true. But if MyAwesomePow ends up not being inlined for whatever reason, then IsConstantExpression(i) will remain false. Note Constant folding only takes place during optimizations. If you've disabled optimizations, the intrinsic returns false."

    "title": "Hint intrinsics | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Hint intrinsics Use the Hint intrinsics to add information to your code which helps with Burst optimization. It has the following methods: Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Hint.Likely: Tells Burst that a Boolean condition is likely to be true. Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Hint.Unlikely: Tells Burst that a Boolean condition is unlikely to be true. Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Hint.Assume: Tells Burst that it can assume a Boolean condition is true. Likely intrinsic The Likely intrinsic is most useful to tell Burst which branch condition has a high probability of being true. This means that Burst can focus on the branch in question for optimization purposes: if (Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Hint.Likely(b)) { // Any code in here will be optimized by Burst with the assumption that we'll probably get here! } else { // Whereas the code in here will be kept out of the way of the optimizer. } Unlikely intrinsic The Unlikely intrinsic tells Burst the opposite of the Likely intrinsic: the condition is unlikely to be true, and it should optimize against it: if (Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Hint.Unlikely(b)) { // Whereas the code in here will be kept out of the way of the optimizer. } else { // Any code in here will be optimized by Burst with the assumption that we'll probably get here! } The Likely and Unlikely intrinsics make sure that Burst places the code most likely to be hit after the branching condition in the binary. This means that the code has a high probability of being in the instruction cache. Burst can also hoist the code out of the likely branch and spend extra time optimizing it, and not spend as much time looking at the unlikely code. An example of an unlikely branch is to check if result of an allocation is valid. The allocation is valid most of all the time, so you want the code to be fast with that assumption, but you want an error case to fall back to. Assume intrinsic The Assume intrinsic is powerful. Use it with caution because it tells Burst that a condition is always true. Warning When you use Assume, Burst assumes the value is true without checking whether it's true. Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Hint.Assume(b); if (b) { // Burst has been told that b is always true, so this branch will always be taken. } else { // Any code in here will be removed from the program because b is always true! } Use the Assume intrinsic to arbitrarily tell Burst that something is true. For example, you can use Assume to tell Burst to assume that a loop end is always a multiple of 16, which means that it can provide perfect vectorization without any scalar spilling for that loop. You could also use it to tell Burst that a value isn't NaN, or it's negative."

    "title": "Loop vectorization | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Loop vectorization Burst uses loop vectorization to improve the performance of your code. It uses this technique to loop over multiple values at the same time, rather than looping over single values at a time, which speeds up the performance of your code. For example: [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)] private static unsafe void Bar([NoAlias] int* a, [NoAlias] int* b, int count) { for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) { a[i] += b[i]; } } public static unsafe void Foo(int count) { var a = stackalloc int[count]; var b = stackalloc int[count]; Bar(a, b, count); } Burst converts the scalar loop in Bar into a vectorized loop. Then, instead of looping over a single value at a time, it generates code that loops over multiple values at the same time, which produces faster code. This is the x64 assembly Burst generates for AVX2 for the loop in Bar above: .LBB1_4: vmovdqu ymm0, ymmword ptr [rdx + 4*rax] vmovdqu ymm1, ymmword ptr [rdx + 4*rax + 32] vmovdqu ymm2, ymmword ptr [rdx + 4*rax + 64] vmovdqu ymm3, ymmword ptr [rdx + 4*rax + 96] vpaddd ymm0, ymm0, ymmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax] vpaddd ymm1, ymm1, ymmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax + 32] vpaddd ymm2, ymm2, ymmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax + 64] vpaddd ymm3, ymm3, ymmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax + 96] vmovdqu ymmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax], ymm0 vmovdqu ymmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax + 32], ymm1 vmovdqu ymmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax + 64], ymm2 vmovdqu ymmword ptr [rcx + 4*rax + 96], ymm3 add rax, 32 cmp r8, rax jne .LBB1_4 Burst has unrolled and vectorized the loop into four vpaddd instructions, which calculate eight integer additions each, for a total of 32 integer additions per loop iteration. Loop vectorization intrinsics Burst includes experimental intrinsics to express loop vectorization assumptions: Loop.ExpectVectorized and Loop.ExpectNotVectorized. Burst then validates the loop vectorization at compile-time. This is useful in a situation where you might break the auto vectorization. For example, if you introduce a branch to the code: [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)] private static unsafe void Bar([NoAlias] int* a, [NoAlias] int* b, int count) { for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) { if (a[i] > b[i]) { break; } a[i] += b[i]; } } This changes the assembly to the following: .LBB1_3: mov r9d, dword ptr [rcx + 4*r10] mov eax, dword ptr [rdx + 4*r10] cmp r9d, eax jg .LBB1_4 add eax, r9d mov dword ptr [rcx + 4*r10], eax inc r10 cmp r8, r10 jne .LBB1_3 This isn't ideal because the loop is scalar and only has 1 integer addition per loop iteration. It can be difficult to spot this happening in your code, so use the experimental intrinsics Loop.ExpectVectorized and Loop.ExpectNotVectorized to express loop vectorization assumptions. Burst then validates the loop vectorization at compile-time. Because the intrinsics are experimental, you need to use the UNITY_BURST_EXPERIMENTAL_LOOP_INTRINSICS preprocessor define to enable them. The following example shows the original Bar example with the Loop.ExpectVectorized intrinsic: [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)] private static unsafe void Bar([NoAlias] int* a, [NoAlias] int* b, int count) { for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) { Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Loop.ExpectVectorized(); a[i] += b[i]; } } Burst then validates at compile-time whether the loop is vectorized. If the loop isn't vectorized, Burst emits a compiler error. The following example produces an error: [MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.NoInlining)] private static unsafe void Bar([NoAlias] int* a, [NoAlias] int* b, int count) { for (var i = 0; i < count; i++) { Unity.Burst.CompilerServices.Loop.ExpectVectorized(); if (a[i] > b[i]) { break; } a[i] += b[i]; } } Burst emits the following error at compile-time: LoopIntrinsics.cs(6,9): Burst error BC1321: The loop is not vectorized where it was expected that it is vectorized. Important These intrinsics don't work inside if statements. Burst doesn't prevent this from happening, so you won't see a compile-time error for this."

The included version has been heavily modified by Rich Felker in 2012, in the interests of size, simplicity, and namespace cleanliness. Much of the math library code (src/math/* and src/complex/*) is Copyright © 1993,2004 Sun Microsystems or Copyright © 2003-2011 David Schultz or Copyright © 2003-2009 Steven G. Kargl or Copyright © 2003-2009 Bruce D. Evans or Copyright © 2008 Stephen L. Moshier and labelled as such in comments in the individual source files. All have been licensed under extremely permissive terms. The ARM memcpy code (src/string/arm/memcpy_el.S) is Copyright © 2008 The Android Open Source Project and is licensed under a two-clause BSD license. It was taken from Bionic libc, used on Android. The implementation of DES for crypt (src/crypt/crypt_des.c) is Copyright © 1994 David Burren. It is licensed under a BSD license. The implementation of blowfish crypt (src/crypt/crypt_blowfish.c) was originally written by Solar Designer and placed into the public domain. The code also comes with a fallback permissive license for use in jurisdictions that may not recognize the public domain. The smoothsort implementation (src/stdlib/qsort.c) is Copyright © 2011 Valentin Ochs and is licensed under an MIT-style license. The x86_64 port was written by Nicholas J. Kain and is licensed under the standard MIT terms. The mips and microblaze ports were originally written by Richard Pennington for use in the ellcc project. The original code was adapted by Rich Felker for build system and code conventions during upstream integration. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms. The mips64 port was contributed by Imagination Technologies and is licensed under the standard MIT terms. The powerpc port was also originally written by Richard Pennington, and later supplemented and integrated by John Spencer. It is licensed under the standard MIT terms. All other files which have no copyright comments are original works produced specifically for use as part of this library, written either by Rich Felker, the main author of the library, or by one or more contibutors listed above. Details on authorship of individual files can be found in the git version control history of the project. The omission of copyright and license comments in each file is in the interest of source tree size. In addition, permission is hereby granted for all public header files (include/* and arch//bits/) and crt files intended to be linked into applications (crt/, ldso/dlstart.c, and arch//crt_arch.h) to omit the copyright notice and permission notice otherwise required by the license, and to use these files without any requirement of attribution. These files include substantial contributions from: Bobby Bingham John Spencer Nicholas J. Kain Rich Felker Richard Pennington Stefan Kristiansson Szabolcs Nagy all of whom have explicitly granted such permission. This file previously contained text expressing a belief that most of the files covered by the above exception were sufficiently trivial not to be subject to copyright, resulting in confusion over whether it negated the permissions granted in the license. In the spirit of permissive licensing, and of not having licensing issues being an obstacle to adoption, that text has been removed.

Commit Changeset Each new change on the history of the repo, grouping several individual file and directory changes. Master Main When you create a repo in Unity VCS, there's always an \"empty\" branch. Unity VCS calls it Main. To checkout To update Downloading content to the workspace (working copy). This is called \"update\" because in Unity VCS, \"checkout\" has a different meaning. Checkout When you checkout a file in Unity VCS, you're saying you are going to modify the file. Exclusive checkout or lock This is locking a file so nobody can touch it. It’s only useful for non-mergeable files, like binaries, images, or art in a video game. Rebase Unity VCS handles branching differently than Git. In Unity VCS, a rebase is just a merge operation. Repository Repository Where the entire history of the project is stored. Working copy Workspace In Git, you have the working copy and the repository in the exact location. You have a working copy and a .git hidden dir with the repository. In Unity VCS, this is slightly different since repositories and workspaces are separated. You can have several workspaces working with the same local repository."

See Version Control. Ignore file A special file used in many Version Control Systems which specifies files to be excluded from version control. In Unity projects, several folders should be excluded from version control. Repository A shared history of changes made to the project's files, saved on a server. Workspace Your local copy of the repository, interacting with the version control system. It's where you download the project's files, make the required changes and perform checkins. Check-in Check-in is the act of submitting changes from your workspace to the shared repository. You can enter a comment before checking in your changes.

In this tab, you can select which files you want to check in, add a comment, and check in the changes. Note : You can check in a specific file using the version control contextual menu in the project view or the Checkin button in the Inspector window. In the example below, the user adds a GameScene. They can check in the scene using the Pending Changes tab or the Checkin option in the contextual menu. Incoming Changes The Incoming Changes tab allows you to view all incoming changes and conflicts and update your local project. Any changes made to your project prompts an \"Incoming changes\" notification at the top right of the version control window. Tip : Check the Incoming Changes tab frequently to avoid facing future change conflicts in your team. Project History Use the Changesets tab to view all changes made to your project as they occur chronologically, along with who made the changes and when. You can sort by columns and alter the chronological view of the story. Double-click any file in a changeset to go to the File History tab, and display every changeset. In the File History view, right-click on a change and click Save the revision as… to restore the file's former state. This is useful if you had previously deleted some logic that you now need. You can also view the changes made to a specific file in the Project view through a contextual menu, then revert to an earlier revision of the file. Locks The File locks tab allows you to list and filter all locks in your repository, and gives you the ability to release or remove them selectively. To open the view, you can use the \"Show Locks\" button available in the toolbar."

    "keywords": "Unity Version Control Package This package provides an in-editor interface for teams to work with Unity Version Control (Unity VCS), our leading version control solution, directly in Unity. Note this project is the natural evolution of the old Collaborate package, hence its name. Documentation - Changelog - Yamato Compatibility The minimum supported version of the Unity Editor is 2020.3.48f1 LTS. Windows and macOS are officially supported. The solution is exclusively targeting .NetStandard 2.0, and will not work with the legacy Mono runtime. Maintenance This project is currently maintained by the VCS Ecosystem team (@vcs-ecosystem-team), part of UGS DevOps. All suggestions and issues are very welcome in the Slack channel #devs-unity-version-control. Development For developers Option 1: clone this repository out into the packages/ directory in a project. Option 2: clone elsewhere and link with the packages/manifest.json file in the project: \"com.unity.collab-proxy\": \"file:/some/path/to/package\" To add testing support also add the testibles section to the manifest. Your manifest should look like this: { \"dependencies\": { \"com.unity.collab-proxy\": \"file:/some/path/to/package\", ... }, \"testables\": [ \"com.unity.collab-proxy\", ... ] } For internal testers Simply add the git url into the packages/manifest.json file: \"com.unity.collab-proxy\": \"git://git@github.cds.internal.unity3d.com:unity/com.unity.cloud.collaborate.git\" If you need a specific revisision: \"com.unity.collab-proxy\": \"git://git@github.cds.internal.unity3d.com:unity/com.unity.cloud.collaborate.git#<rev>\" If you need more information, read the Documentation for package dependencies from git. Code style is as dictated in Unity Meta."

Updated package com.unity.burst to version 1.6.4. [1.2.1] - 2022-02-17 Fixed Shutdown the WordStorage with application exit to ensure memory is freed. NativeList.AsDeferredJobArray allocator label is changed to Allocator.Invalid to infer that the array is in list mode. Added Added FixedStringMethods.CopyFromTruncated to copy a string to a FixedString explicitly allowing truncation Added NativeText.ReadOnly type which provides a readonly, lightweight copy of a NativeText or UnsafeText type. New public API AllocatorHandle.UnmanagedUnregister, which unregisters an allocator without using managed code. Changed Native/UnsafeMultiHashMap.GetUniqueKeyArrayNBC extension methods from Unity.Collections.NotBurstCompatible are not necessary anymore. Burst supports tuple. Original methods Native/UnsafeMultiHashMap.GetUniqueKeyArray are now available again. Reverted some NativeArray test changes that were introduced in 1.0.0-pre.4 Static safety ID created for all types containing a uniquely represented AtomicSafetyHandle [1.1.0] - 2021-10-27 Added REMOVE_DISPOSE_SENTINEL ifdefs in all containers for future removal of DisposeSentinel. Bounds check to Fixed/Native/UnsafeList. SetCapacity and TrimExcess to NativeList. A custom allocator wrapper AllocatorHelper to facilitate custom allocator creation and destruction. NativeList<>.ArraysEqual & UnsafeList<>.ArraysEqual UnsafeList.CopyFrom Changed Only lower 15 bits of an allocator handle version are valid. Fixed Error in leak detection for NativeList created by RewindableAllocator. Removed pointer caching from Native/UnsafeList.ParallelWriter. AtomicSafetyHandle issue preventing use of foreach iterator in jobs for NativeHashSet, NativeHashMap, and NativeMultiHashMap containers. [1.0.0-pre.6] - 2021-08-31 Removed VirtualMemoryUtility BaselibErrorState BaselibSourceLocation VMRange DisposeSentinel (managed object) from all Native* containers. Changed Native container memory allocations align to multiple cacheline size. UnsafeText is marshalable now (doesn't contain generic field UnsafeList ). Fixed AllocatorManager.AllocateBlock no longer ignores alignment when allocating. Redundant and wrong computation of memory allocation alignment. [1.0.0-pre.5] - 2021-08-20 Changed Renamed FixedListN to FixedListNBytes, for all N, and same for FixedString Fixed NativeBitArray, NativeQueue, NativeStream, and NativeText will no longer throw an exception when using a custom allocator inside of a job. [1.0.0-pre.4] - 2021-08-11 Added FixedList* overflow checks when UNITY_DOTS_DEBUG is enabled. Disposed NativeArray related tests and updated some invalidated native array from native list tests to confirm that exceptions are thrown when accessing an object's Length and indexer following its disposal Changed Updated internal dependencies InvalidArrayAccessFromListJob check in the InvalidatedArrayAccessFromListThrowsInsideJob unit test to expect an ObjectDisposedException due to a change in the type thrown for AtomicSafetyHandle.CheckAndThrow Fixed Setting UnsafeList.Length will now resize the storage properly. [1.0.0-pre.3] - 2021-06-29 Added Native/UnsafeList*.RemoveRange* with index/count arguments. Upgraded to burst 1.5.2 UnsafeText added. Changed Burst compatibility tests now treat any explicit uses of [BurstCompatible] on private methods as an error (as opposed to silently ignoring) to avoid giving the impression that private methods are being tested. NativeList<T> generic constraint T is changed from struct to unmanaged to match UnsafeList<T>. User code can be simply fixed by changing struct to unmanaged when using NativeList<T> inside generic container. NativeHashMap.GetBucketData renamed to NativeHashMap.GetUnsafeBucketData Update the package to 1.0.0 HeapString renamed to NativeText. NativeText is based on UnsafeText. Deprecated Generated FixedList[Byte/Int/Float][32/64/128/256/512] are deprecated, and replaced with generics FixedList[32/64/128/256/512]<T>. UnsafeMultiHashMap<TKey, TValue>.GetUniqueKeyArray replaced with extension method UnsafeMultiHashMap<TKey, TValue>.GetUniqueKeyValueNBC from Unity.Collections.NotBurstCompatible namespace. NativeMultiHashMap<TKey, TValue>.GetUniqueKeyArray replaced with extension method NativeMultiHashMap<TKey, TValue>.GetUniqueKeyValueNBC from Unity.Collections.NotBurstCompatible namespace. NativeList<T>.ToArray replaced with extension method NativeList<T>.ToArrayNBC from Unity.Collections.NotBurstCompatible NativeList<T>.CopyFrom replaced with extension method NativeList<T>.CopyFromNBC from Unity.Collections.NotBurstCompatible namespace. UnsafeAppendBuffer.Add replaced with extension methodUnsafeAppendBuffer.AddNBC from Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.NotBurstCompatible namespace. UnsafeAppendBuffer.ToBytes replaced with extension method UnsafeAppendBuffer.ToBytesNBC from Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.NotBurstCompatible namespace. UnsafeAppendBuffer.Reader.ReadNext replaced with extension method UnsafeAppendBuffer.Reader.ReadNextNBC from Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.NotBurstCompatible namespace. Native/UnsafeList*.RemoveRange*WithBeginEnd methods with begin/end arguments in favor of Native/UnsafeList*.RemoveRange* with index/count arguments. UnsafeList and replaced it with UnsafeList<T>. VirtualMemoryUtility. Removed NativeQueue.PersistentMemoryBlockCount and NativeQueue.MemoryBlockSize are now internal APIs. Fixed Burst compatibility tests will now ignore any method containing a '$' in the name, which can be generated by the Burst direct call IL post processor. xxHash3 is initialized after assembly load to avoid an exception that could be thrown if xxHash3 is accessed for the first time on a thread other than the main thread. Security [0.17.0] - 2021-03-15 Added [NotBurstCompatible] attribute to FixedStringN constructors that use a String argument. [NotBurstCompatible] attribute to NativeQueue constructor. UnsafeList<T>.Create and UnsafeList<T>.Destroy API. BurstCompatibilityTests now has a constructor that accepts multiple assembly names to verify Burst compatibility. This allows one test to verify multiple assemblies and can dramatically reduce CI times by avoiding costly setup overhead. UnsafePtrList<T> to replace deprecated untyped UnsafePtrList. Burst compatibility tests now also write the generated code to the Temp directory in order to make it easier to inspect. FixedList*.RemoveRange* with index/count arguments. FixedString parsing to type uint Deprecated untyped UnsafePtrList, and added UnsafePtrList<T> as replacement. FixedList*.RemoveRange*WithBeginEnd methods with begin/end arguments in favor of FixedList*.RemoveRange* with index/count arguments. Removed Removed single arg FixedString*.Format extension methods, use Clear() followed by Append(). CollectionsBurstTests has been removed and placed into the Entities test project. com.unity.test-framework.performance preview package dependency, and moved performance unit tests depending on it into different location. Fixed *BitArray.Clear when clearing with very short bit arrays. NativeQueue.AsParallelWriter doesn't need to be cached when chaining jobs. Removed unnecessary safety handle that was preventing calling NativeQueue.AsParallelWriter() multiple times when scheduling jobs. [0.16.0] - 2021-01-26 Deprecated Sort methods that return a JobHandle deprecated in favor of new SortJob methods that return a job struct. Less conveniently, the user is responsible for calling Schedule on the struct, but this pattern better accommodates scheduling generic jobs from Bursted code (See https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.entities@latest/index.html?subfolder=/manual/ecs_generic_jobs.html). Removed Removed deprecated FixedListN.IndexOf and SortJob variants Fixed An ENABLE_UNITY_COLLECTIONS_CHECKS define was misspelled. Now Memory is checked for reasonable byte length when enabled. Many methods that use IJob were marked as [NotBurstCompatible] to reflect their true Burst compatibility. Changed Updated com.unity.burst to 1.4.4 [0.15.0] - 2020-11-13 Added NativeReference constructor to initialize it with existing value. T[] *HashSet.ToArray() returns an array of all elements in the set. xxHash3 now also has a utility method to hash a struct directly (Previously it was only pointer + size) [BurstCompatible] attribute to FixedList and extensions. [BurstCompatible] attribute to CollectionHelper. [BurstCompatible] attribute to FixedBytesN. [BurstCompatible] attribute to HeapString. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeArrayExtensions. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeBitArray. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeBitArrayUnsafeUtility. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeHashMap. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeHashMapExtensions. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeHashSet. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeList. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeListUnsafeUtility. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeMultiHashMap. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeQueue. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeReference. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeStream. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeString. [BurstCompatible] attribute to UTF8ArrayUnsafeUtility. [BurstCompatible] attribute to Unicode and Rune. [BurstCompatible] attribute to NativeStringView. [BurstCompatible] attribute to UnsafeAppendBuffer. [BurstCompatible] attribute to UnsafeAtomicCounter32 and UnsafeAtomicCounter64. [BurstCompatible] attribute to UnsafeHashMap. [BurstCompatible] attribute to UnsafeHashSet. [BurstCompatible] attribute to UnsafeList, UnsafeListExtensions, UnsafePtrList, UnsafePtrListExtensions. [BurstCompatible] attribute to UnsafeRingQueue. [BurstCompatible] attribute to UnsafeScratchAllocator. [BurstCompatible] attribute to UnsafeUtilityExtensions. [BurstCompatible] attribute to VMRange, Baselib_ErrorState, and VirtualMemoryUtility. [BurstCompatible] attribute to xxHash3. Changed Update burst to 1.4.1. *BitArray Length would previously report backing capacity which is always 64-bit aligned, changed it to report number of bits user requested on allocation. For example, allocating 3 bits will now report Length 3 instead capacity which is always aligned to 64-bits. Update minimum editor version to 2020.1.2f1 Fixed Code generation for indexers in structs with [BurstCompatible] attribute. *BitArray search for empty bits when number of bits is less than 7 and backing storage is fragmented with 0x81 bit pattern. Namespace for *HashSet.ExceptWith/IntersectWith/UnionWith extension methods, so that use of Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe namespace is not necessary. using FixedList.ToNativeArray with collection checks enabled used to throw a null reference exception. [0.14.0] - 2020-09-24 Added *UnsafeBitArray.Find with pos/count search range arguments. Changed UnsafeStream block allocation performance has been improved by ~16% by appending to the start of the per-thread block lists rather than the end. Removed FixedList*.InsertRange, FixedList*.RemoveRangeSwapBack, FixedList*.RemoveRange, NativeString*, NativeList.RemoveRangeSwapBack, NativeList.RemoveRange, UnsafeList.RemoveRangeSwapBack, UnsafeList.RemoveRange, FixedString*.Format, FixedString*.AppendFrom, NativeHashSet.TryAdd, UnsafeHashSet.TryAdd. [NativeContainerSupportsDeallocateOnJobCompletion] attribute from NativeReference container. It didn't work properly. Users can use Dispose(JobHandle) method instead. Fixed FixedList<T> Remove and RemoveSwapBack extension methods were modifying copy, fixed by passing this by reference to modify actual container. [0.13.0] - 2020-08-26 Added Added *BitArray.Find linear search for 0-bit range. Added SortJob extension methods for NativeList, UnsafeList, UnsafeList<T>, and NativeSlice. Added Sort method that accepts custom comparator, and job dependency, to all supported containers. Added BinarySearch extension methods for NativeArray, NativeList, UnsafeList, UnsafeList<T>, and NativeSlice. Added foreach support to UnsafeList<T>. Changed Sort functions that take an IComparer no longer require the sorted elements to be IComparable Bumped Burst to 1.3.5. Deprecated Deprecated SortJob with default job dependency argument. Use Sort that require an explicit JobHandle argument. If no dependency is needed, pass a default valued JobHandle. Removed Removed: UnsafeUtilityEx, Unity.Collections.Experimental*,FixedString*.UTF8LengthInBytes, and *Stream.ComputeItemCount() Fixed Fixed performance regression of *HashMap.Count() introduced in Collections 0.10.0. [0.12.0] - 2020-08-04 Added Added Sort method with custom comparer to FixedList* and UnsafeList<T>. Added IsEmpty property and Clear method to INativeList intefrace. Added INativeDisposable interface which provides a mechanism for scheduling release of unmanaged resources. Added InsertRangeWithBeginEnd to NativeList, UnsafeList, UnsafeList<T>, and UnsafePtrList. Added AddRange and AddRangeNoResize to FixedList*. Added properties to BaselibErrorState to check if an operation resulted in success, out of memory, or accessing an invalid address range. Added HeapString type, for arbitrary-length (up to 2GB) heap-allocated strings compatible with the FixedString* methods. Allocating a HeapString requires specifying an allocator and disposing appropriately. Deprecated Deprecated FixedList* method IndexOf with index and index/count arguments. Removed Removed: IJobNativeMultiHashMapMergedSharedKeyIndices JobNativeMultiHashMapUniqueHashExtensions IJobNativeMultiHashMapVisitKeyValue JobNativeMultiHashMapVisitKeyValue IJobNativeMultiHashMapVisitKeyMutableValue JobNativeMultiHashMapVisitKeyMutableValue IJobUnsafeMultiHashMapMergedSharedKeyIndices JobUnsafeMultiHashMapUniqueHashExtensions IJobUnsafeMultiHashMapVisitKeyValue JobUnsafeMultiHashMapVisitKeyValue IJobUnsafeMultiHashMapVisitKeyMutableValue JobUnsafeMultiHashMapVisitKeyMutableValue Fixed Fixed *HashMap.IsEmpty when items are added and removed from *HashMap. IsEmpty previously used allocated count only to report emptiness, but returning not-empty didn't actually meant that *HashMap is not empty. Fixed bug where *HashSet.Enumerator.Current would always return the default value instead of the actual value from the set. Fixed bug with *HashMap/Set.Enumerator returning wrong index and dereferencing out of bounds memory. [0.11.0] - 2020-07-10 Added Added VirtualMemoryUtility providing low-level virtual memory utility functions backed by baselib. *HashMap and *HashSet now implement IEnumerable<>. ReadArrayElementBoundsChecked and WriteArrayElementBoundsChecked for ease of debugging ReadArrayElement and WriteArrayElement without sacrificing performance by adding bounds checking directly to those functions. Added InsertRangeWithBeginEnd, RemoveRangeSwapBackWithBeginEnd, and RemoveRangeWithBeginEnd to list containers. *WithBeginEnd in name signifies that arguments are begin/end instead of more standard index/count. Once InsertRange, RemoveRangeSwapBack, and RemoveRange are completely deprecated and removed, those methods will be added with correct index/count arguments. Added xxHash3 type to expose 64/128bits hashing API using xxHash3 algorithm (corresponding to the C++ version https://github.com/Cyan4973/xxHash/releases/tag/v0.8.0) Changed Updated minimum Unity Editor version to 2020.1.0b15 (40d9420e7de8) Bumped burst to 1.3.2 version. Changed *HashSet.Add API to return bool when adding element to set. UnsafeUtilityExtensions is now public. NativeReference methods Equals and GetHashCode will now operate on the value instead of the data pointer. FixedString{32,64,128,512,4096} have been reworked. Functionality is shared via generics as much as possible. The API attempts to follow StringBuilder semantics. Append methods now consistently append. Append variant to append a char was added (appends the char, does not resolve to int overload). Format methods that replaced the contents of the target have been deprecated. Use Clear() followed by Append(). Because FixedStrings start out cleared, in most cases just an Append is sufficient. Format that takes a format string has been renamed to AppendFormat. The static FixedString.Format methods still exist for convenience, and return a FixedString128. It is possible for users to extend the Append family of methods to support appending their own types. See FixedStringAppendMethods.cs for examples of how to declare your own extension methods. Deprecated Deprecated *HashSet.TryAdd. *HashSet.Add is equivalent. Deprecated NativeString*. The functionality is replaced by FixedString*. Deprecated InsertRange, RemoveRangeSwap, and RemoveRange from list containers, and added InsertRangeWithBeginEnd, RemoveRangeSwapBackWithBeginEnd, and RemoveRangeWithBeginEnd. *WithBeginEnd in name signifies that arguments are begin/end instead of more standard index/count. Once InsertRange, RemoveRangeSwapBack, and RemoveRange are completely deprecated and removed, those methods will be added with correct index/count arguments. Removed Removed System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe.dll from package. Known Issues This version is not compatible with 2020.2.0a17. Please update to the forthcoming alpha. All containers allocated with Allocator.Temp on the same thread use a shared AtomicSafetyHandle instance. This is problematic when using NativeHashMap, NativeMultiHashMap, NativeHashSet and NativeList together in situations where their secondary safety handle is used. This means that operations that invalidate an enumerator for either of these collections (or the NativeArray returned by NativeList.AsArray) will also invalidate all other previously acquired enumerators. For example, this will throw when safety checks are enabled: var list = new NativeList<int>(Allocator.Temp); list.Add(1); // This array uses the secondary safety handle of the list, which is // shared between all Allocator.Temp allocations. var array = list.AsArray(); var list2 = new NativeHashSet<int>(Allocator.Temp); // This invalidates the secondary safety handle, which is also used // by the list above. list2.TryAdd(1); // This throws an InvalidOperationException because the shared safety // handle was invalidated. var x = array[0]; This defect will be addressed in a future release. [0.10.0] - 2020-05-27 Added Added Native/UnsafeHashSet containers. Added IsEmpty method to *Queue, *HashMap, *MultiHashMap, *List, FixedString. This method should be prefered to Count() > 0 due to simpler checks for empty container. Added a new container NativeReference to hold unmanaged allocation. Added CollectionsTestFixture to enable jobs debugger and verify safety checks are enabled. Added NativeList.CopyFrom(NativeArray<> array) Changed Updated minimum Unity Editor version to 2020.1.0b9 (9c0aec301c8d) Updated package com.unity.burst to version 1.3.0-preview.12. Made several tests inherit CollectionsTestFixture to prevent crashing when running tests without jobs debugger or safety checks enabled. Added NativeBitArray.AsNativeArray<T> method to reinterpret NativeBitArray as NativeArray of desired type. Deprecated Deprecated NativeArrayChunked8 and NativeArrayFullSOA from Unity.Collections.Experimental. Deprecated UnsafeUtilityEx.As/AsRef/ArrayElementAsRef.

[0.9.0] - 2020-05-04 Added Added RemoveAt and RemoveRange to List containers in collections. These methods remove elements in list container while preserving order of the list. These methods are slower than Remove*SwapBack methods and users should prefer Remove*SwapBack if they don't care about preserving order inside *List container. Added *BitArray.Copy between two different bit arrays. Added NativeBitArrayUnsafeUtility.ConvertExistingDataToNativeBitArray for assigning view into data as bit array. Changed Updated package com.unity.burst to version 1.3.0-preview.11 Fixed Moved NativeMultiHashMap.Remove<TValueEQ>(TKey key, TValueEq value) into an extension method and made it Burst compatible Fixed bug in *HashMap.Remove to not throw when removing from empty hash map.

Deprecated Deprecated IJobNativeMultiHashMapMergedSharedKeyIndices, JobNativeMultiHashMapUniqueHashExtensions, IJobNativeMultiHashMapVisitKeyValue, JobNativeMultiHashMapVisitKeyValue, IJobNativeMultiHashMapVisitKeyMutableValue, JobNativeMultiHashMapVisitKeyMutableValue, and introduced NativeHashMap.GetUnsafeBucketData and NativeMultiHashMap.GetUnsafeBucketData to obtain internals to implement deprecated functionality inside user code. If this functionality is used, the best is to copy deprecated code into user code. Removed Removed expired API class TerminatesProgramAttribute [0.7.1] - 2020-04-08 Deprecated Deprecated Length property from NativeHashMap, UnsafeHashMap, NativeMultiHashMap, UnsafeMultiHashMap, NativeQueue, and replaced it with Count() to reflect that there is computation being done.

Added missing IDisposable constraint to UnsafeList and UnsafeBitArray. Added ReadNextArray<T> to access a raw array (pointer and length) from an UnsafeAppendBuffer.Reader. Added FixedString types, guaranteed binary-layout identical to NativeString types, which they are intended to replace. Added FixedList<T> generic self-contained List struct Added BitArray.SetBits with arbitrary ulong value. Added BitArray.GetBits to retrieve bits as ulong value. Changed Changed UnsafeBitArray memory initialization option default to NativeArrayOptions.ClearMemory. Changed FixedList structs to pad to natural alignment of item held in list Deprecated BlobAssetComputationContext.AssociateBlobAssetWithGameObject(int, GameObject) replaced by its UnityEngine.Object counterpart BlobAssetComputationContext.AssociateBlobAssetWithUnityObject(int, UnityEngine.Object) to allow association of BlobAsset with any kind of UnityEngine.Object derived types. Adding removal dates to the API that have been deprecated but did not have the date set. Removed Removed IEquatable constraint from UnsafeList<T>. Fixed Fixed BitArray.SetBits. [0.4.0] - 2019-12-16 This version requires Unity 2019.3.0f1+ New Features Adding FixedListTN as a non-generic replacement for ResizableArrayN<T>. Added UnsafeBitArray providing arbitrary sized bit array functionality. Fixes Updated performance package dependency to 1.3.2 which fixes an obsoletion warning Adding [NativeDisableUnsafePtrRestriction] to UnsafeList to allow burst compilation. [0.3.0] - 2019-12-03 New Features Added fixed-size BitField32 and BitField64 bit array. Changes Removed the following deprecated API as announced in/before 0.1.1-preview: Removed struct Concurrent and ToConcurrent() for NativeHashMap, NativeMultiHashMap and NativeQueue (replaced by the ParallelWriter API). From NativeStream.cs: struct NativeStreamReader and struct NativeStreamWriter, replaced by struct NativeStream.Reader and struct NativeStream.Writer. From NativeList.cs: ToDeferredJobArray() (replaced by AsDeferredJobArray() API). [0.2.0] - 2019-11-22 This version requires Unity 2019.3 0b11+ New Features Added fixed-size UTF-8 NativeString in sizes of 32, 64, 128, 512, and 4096 bytes. Added HPC# functions for float-to-string and string-to-float. Added HPC# functions for int-to-string and string-to-int. Added HPC# functions for UTF16-to-UTF8 and UTF8-to-UTF16. New Native(Multi)HashMap.GetKeyValueArrays that will query keys and values at the same time into parallel arrays. Added UnsafeStream, UnsafeHashMap, and UnsafeMultiHashMap, providing functionality of NativeStream container but without any safety mechanism (intended for advanced users only). Added AddNoResize methods to NativeList. When it's known ahead of time that list won't grow, these methods won't try to resize. Rather exception will be thrown if capacity is insufficient. Added ParallelWriter support for UnsafeList. Added UnsafeList.TrimExcess to set capacity to actual number of elements in the container. Added convenience blittable UnsafeList<T> managed container with unmanaged T constraint. Changes UnsafeList.Resize now doesn't resize to lower capacity. User must call UnsafeList.SetCapacity to lower capacity of the list. This applies to all other containers based on UnsafeList. Updated dependencies for this package. Fixes Fixed NativeQueue pool leak. [0.1.1] - 2019-08-06 Fixes NativeHashMap.Remove(TKey key, TValueEQ value) is now supported in bursted code. Adding deprecated NativeList.ToDeferredJobArray() back in - Use AsDeferredJobArray() instead. The deprecated function will be removed in 3 months. This can not be auto-upgraded prior to Unity 2019.3. Fixing bug where TryDequeue on an empty NativeQueue that previously had enqueued elements could leave it in an invalid state where Enqueue would fail silently afterwards. Changes Updated dependencies for this package. [0.1.0] - 2019-07-30 New Features NativeMultiHashMap.Remove(key, value) has been addded. It lets you remove all key & value pairs from the hashmap.

    "title": "Using unmanaged memory | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Using unmanaged memory The Native- and Unsafe- collections in this package are allocated from unmanaged memory, meaning their existence is unknown to the garbage collector. You are responsible for deallocating any unmanaged memory that you no longer need. Failing to deallocate large or numerous allocations can lead to wasting more and more memory, which may eventually slow down or even crash your program. Allocators An allocator governs some unmanaged memory from which you can make allocations. Different allocators organize and track their memory in different ways. The three standard provided allocators are: Allocator.Temp The fastest allocator. For very short-lived allocations. Temp allocations cannot be passed into jobs. Each frame, the main thread creates a Temp allocator which is deallocated in its entirety at the end of the frame. Each job also creates one Temp allocator per thread, and these are deallocated in their entireties at the end of the job. Because a Temp allocator gets discarded as a whole, you actually don't need to manually deallocate your Temp allocations (in fact, doing so is a no-op). Temp allocations are only safe to use within the thread where they were allocated. So while Temp allocations can be made within a job, main thread Temp allocations cannot be passed into a job. For example, a NativeArray that's Temp allocated in the main thread cannot be passed into a job. Allocator.TempJob The next fastest allocator. For short-lived allocations. TempJob allocations can be passed into jobs. You are expected to deallocate your TempJob allocations within 4 frames of their creation. The number 4 was chosen because it's common to want allocations that last a couple frames: the limit of 4 accommodates this need with a comfortable extra margin. For the Native- collection types, the disposal safety checks will throw an exception if a TempJob allocation lives longer than 4 frames. For the Unsafe- collection types, you are still expected to deallocate them within 4 frames, but no safety checks are performed to ensure you do so. Allocator.Persistent The slowest allocator. For indefinite lifetime allocations. Persistent allocations can be passed into jobs. Because Persistent allocations are allowed to live indefinitely, no safety check can detect if a Persistent allocation has outlived its intended lifetime. Consequently, you should be extra careful to deallocate a Persistent allocation when you no longer need it. Disposal (deallocation) Each collection retains a reference to the allocator from which its memory was allocated because deallocation requires specifying the allocator. An Unsafe- collection's Dispose method deallocates its memory. A Native- collection's Dispose method deallocates its memory and frees the handles needed for safety checks. An enumerator's Dispose method is a no-op. The method is included only to fulfill the IEnumerator<T> interface. We often want to dispose a collection after the jobs which need it have run. The Dispose(JobHandle) method creates and schedules a job which will dispose the collection, and this new job takes the input handle as its dependency. Effectively, the method differs disposal until after the dependency runs: NativeArray<int> nums = new NativeArray<int>(10, Allocator.TempJob); // Create and schedule a job that uses the array. ExampleJob job = new ExampleJob { Nums = nums }; JobHandle handle = job.Schedule(); // Create and schedule a job that will dispose the array after the ExampleJob has run. // Returns the handle of the new job. handle = nums.Dispose(handle); The IsCreated property The IsCreated property of a collection is false only in two cases: Immediately after creating a collection with its default constructor. After Dispose has been called on the collection. Understand, however, that you're not intended to use a collections's default constructor. It's only made available because C# requires all structs to have a public default constructor. Also note that calling Dispose on a collection sets IsCreated to false only in that struct, not in any copies of the struct. Consequently, IsCreated may still be true even after the collection's underlying memory was deallocated if... Dispose was called on a different copy of the struct. Or the underlying memory was deallocated via an alias. Aliasing An alias is a collection which does not have its own allocation but instead shares the allocation of another collection, in whole or in part. For example, an UnsafeList can be created that doesn't allocate its own memory but instead uses a NativeList's allocation. Writing to this shared memory via the UnsafeList affects the content of the NativeList, and vice versa. You do not need to dispose aliases, and in fact, calling Dispose on an alias does nothing. Once an original is disposed, the aliases of that original can no longer be used: NativeList<int> nums = new NativeList<int>(10, Allocator.TempJob); nums.Length = 5; // Create an array of 5 ints that aliases the content of the list. NativeArray<int> aliasedNums = nums.AsArray(); // Modify the first element of both the array and the list. aliasedNums[0] = 99; // Only the original need be disposed. nums.Dispose(); // Throws an ObjectDisposedException because disposing // the original deallocates the aliased memory. aliasedNums[0] = 99; Aliasing can be useful in a few scenarios: Getting a collection's data in the form of another collection type without copying the data. For example, you can create an UnsafeList that aliases a NativeArray. Getting a subrange of a collection's data without copying the data. For example, you can create an UnsafeList that aliases a subrange of another list or array. Array reinterpretation. Perhaps surprisingly, it's allowed for an Unsafe- collection to alias a Native- collection even though such cases undermine the safety checks. For example, if an UnsafeList aliases a NativeList, it's not safe to schedule a job that accesses one while also another job is scheduled that accesses the other, but the safety checks do not catch these cases. It is your responsibility to avoid such mistakes. Array reinterpretation A reinterpretation of an array is an alias of the array that reads and writes the content as a different element type. For example, a NativeArray<int> which reinterprets a NativeArray<ushort> shares the same bytes, but it reads and writes the bytes as ints instead of ushorts; because each int is 4 bytes while each ushort is 2 bytes, each int corresponds to two ushorts, and the reinterpretation has half the length of the original. NativeArray<int> ints = new NativeArray<int>(10, Allocator.Temp); // Length of the reinterpreted array is 20 // (because it has two shorts per one int of the original). NativeArray<short> shorts = ints.Reinterpret<int, short>(); // Modifies the first 4 bytes of the array. shorts[0] = 1; shorts[1] = 1; int val = ints[0]; // val is 65537 (2^16 + 2^0) // Like with other aliased collections, only the original // needs to be disposed. ints.Dispose(); // Throws an ObjectDisposedException because disposing // the original deallocates the aliased memory. shorts[0] = 1;"

Max capacity depends upon T. FixedList32Bytes<T> has variants of larger sizes: FixedList64Bytes<T>, FixedList128Bytes<T>, FixedList512Bytes<T>, FixedList4096Bytes<T>. There are no multi-dimensional array types, but you can simply pack all the data into a single-dimension. For example, for an int[4][5] array, use an int[20] array instead (because 4 * 5 is 20). When using the Entities package, a DynamicBuffer component is often the best choice for an array- or list-like collection.

Has thread- and disposal-safety checks. @Unity.Collections.FixedString32Bytes A 32-byte UTF-8 encoded string, including 3 bytes of overhead, so 29 bytes available for storage. FixedString32Bytes has variants of larger sizes: FixedString64Bytes, FixedString128Bytes, FixedString512Bytes, FixedString4096Bytes. See also @Unity.Collections.FixedStringMethods Other types Data structure Description @Unity.Collections.NativeReference`1 A reference to a single value. Functionally equivalent to an array of length 1. Has thread- and disposal-safety checks. @Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.UnsafeAtomicCounter32 A 32-bit atomic counter. @Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.UnsafeAtomicCounter64 A 64-bit atomic counter. Job safety checks The purpose of the job safety checks is to detect job conflicts. Two jobs conflict if: Both jobs access the same data. One job or both jobs have write access to the data. In other words, there's no conflict if both jobs just have read only access to the data. For example, you generally wouldn't want one job to read an array while meanwhile another job is writing the same array, so the safety checks consider that possibility to be a conflict. To resolve such conflicts, you must make one job a dependency of the other to ensure their execution does not overlap. Whichever of the two jobs you want to run first should be the dependency of the other. When the safety checks are enabled, each Native- collection has an AtomicSafetyHandle for performing thread-safety checks. Scheduling a job locks the AtomicSafetyHandle's of all Native- collections in the job. Completing a job releases the AtomicSafetyHandle's of all Native- collections in the job. While a Native- collection's AtomicSafetyHandle is locked: Jobs which use the collection can only be scheduled if they depend upon all the already scheduled job(s) which also use it. Accessing the collection from the main thread will throw an exception. Read only access in jobs As a special case, there's no conflict between two jobs if they both strictly just read the same data, .e.g. there's no conflict if one job reads from an array while meanwhile another also job reads from the same array. The @Unity.Collections.ReadOnlyAttribute marks a Native- collection in a job struct as being read only: public struct MyJob : IJob { // This array can only be read in the job. [ReadOnly] public NativeArray<int> nums; public void Execute() { // If safety checks are enabled, an exception is thrown here // because the array is read only. nums[0] = 100; } } Marking collections as read only has two benefits: The main thread can still read a collection if all scheduled jobs that use the collection have just read only access. The safety checks will not object if you schedule multiple jobs with read only access to the same collection, even without any dependencies between them. Therefore these jobs can run concurrently with each other. Enumerators Most of the collections have a GetEnumerator method, which returns an implementation of IEnumerator<T>. The enumerator's MoveNext method advances its Current property to the next element. NativeList<int> nums = new NativeList<int>(10, Allocator.Temp); // Calculate the sum of all elements in the list. int sum = 0; NativeArray<int>.Enumerator enumerator = nums.GetEnumerator(); // The first MoveNext call advances the enumerator to the first element. // MoveNext returns false when the enumerator has advanced past the last element. while (enumerator.MoveNext()) { sum += enumerator.Current; } // The enumerator is no longer valid to use after the array is disposed. nums.Dispose(); Parallel readers and writers Several of the collection types have nested types for reading and writing from parallel jobs. For example, to write safely to a NativeList<T> from a parallel job, you need a NativeList<T>.ParallelWriter: NativeList<int> nums = new NativeList<int>(1000, Allocator.TempJob); // The parallel writer shares the original list's AtomicSafetyHandle. var job = new MyParallelJob {NumsWriter = nums.AsParallelWriter()}; public struct MyParallelJob : IJobParallelFor { public NativeList<int>.ParallelWriter NumsWriter; public void Execute(int i) { // A NativeList<T>.ParallelWriter can append values // but not grow the capacity of the list. NumsWriter.AddNoResize(i); } } Note that these parallel readers and writers do not usually support the full functionality of the collection. For example, a NativeList cannot grow its capacity in a parallel job (because there is no way to safely allow this without incurring significantly more synchronization overhead). Deterministic reading and writing Although a ParallelWriter ensures the safety of concurrent writes, the order of the concurrent writes is inherently indeterminstic because it depends upon the happenstance of thread scheduling (which is controlled by the operating system and other factors outside of your program's control). Likewise, although a ParallelReader ensures the safety of concurrent reads, the order of the concurrent reads is inherently indeterminstic, so it can't be known which threads will read which values. One solution is to use either @Unity.Collections.NativeStream or @Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe.UnsafeStream, which splits reads and writes into a separate buffer for each thread and thereby avoids indeterminism. Alternatively, you can effectively get a deterministic order of parallel reads if you deterministically divide the reads into separate ranges and process each range in its own thread. You can also get a deterministic order if you deterministically sort the data after it has been written to the list."

    "keywords": "Unity Collections package This package provides unmanaged data structures that can be used in jobs and Burst-compiled code. The collections provided by this package fall into three categories: The collection types in Unity.Collections whose names start with Native- have safety checks for ensuring that they're properly disposed and are used in a thread-safe manner. The collection types in Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe whose names start with Unsafe- do not have these safety checks. The remaining collection types are not allocated and contain no pointers, so effectively their disposal and thread safety are never a concern. These types hold only small amounts of data. The Native- types perform safety checks to ensure that indexes passed to their methods are in bounds, but the other types in most cases do not. Several Native- types have Unsafe- equivalents, for example, NativeList has UnsafeList, and NativeHashMap has UnsafeHashMap. While you should generally prefer using the Native- collections over their Unsafe- equivalents, Native- collections cannot contain other Native- collections (owing to the implementation of their safety checks). So if, say, you want a list of lists, you can have a NativeList<UnsafeList<T>> or an UnsafeList<UnsafeList<T>>, but you cannot have a NativeList<NativeList<T>>. When safety checks are disabled, there is generally no significant performance difference between a Native- type and its Unsafe- equivalent. In fact, most Native- collections are implemented simply as wrappers of their Unsafe- counterparts. For example, NativeList is comprised of an UnsafeList plus a few handles used by the safety checks. For more information on the specific collection types, see the documentation on Collection types"

On the one hand, this is fine because Temp allocated collections cannot be passed into jobs. On the other hand, this is problematic when using NativeHashMap, NativeMultiHashMap, NativeHashSet, and NativeList together in situations where their secondary safety handle is used. (A secondary safety handle ensures that a NativeArray which aliases a NativeList gets invalidated when the NativeList is reallocated due to resizing.) Operations that invalidate an enumerator for these collection types (or invalidate the NativeArray returned by NativeList.AsArray) will also invalidate all other previously acquired enumerators. For example, this will throw when safety checks are enabled: var list = new NativeList<int>(Allocator.Temp); list.Add(1); // This array uses the secondary safety handle of the list, which is // shared between all Allocator.Temp allocations. var array = list.AsArray(); var list2 = new NativeHashSet<int>(Allocator.Temp); // This invalidates the secondary safety handle, which is also used // by the list above. list2.TryAdd(1); // This throws an InvalidOperationException because the shared safety // handle was invalidated. var x = array[0]; This defect will be addressed in a future release."

Package CI Summary Documentation https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.collections@0.14/manual/index.html Data structures The Unity.Collections package includes the following data structures: Data structure | Description | Documentation ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------- BitField32 | Fixed size 32-bit array of bits. | Documentation BitField64 | Fixed size 64-bit array of bits. | Documentation NativeBitArray | Arbitrary sized array of bits. | Documentation UnsafeBitArray | Arbitrary sized array of bits, without any thread safety check features. | Documentation NativeHashMap | Unordered associative array, a collection of keys and values. | Documentation UnsafeHashMap | Unordered associative array, a collection of keys and values, without any thread safety check features. | Documentation NativeHashSet | Set of values. | Documentation UnsafeHashSet | Set of values, without any thread safety check features. | Documentation NativeList | An unmanaged, resizable list. | Documentation UnsafeList | An unmanaged, resizable list, without any thread safety check features. | Documentation NativeMultiHashMap | Unordered associative array, a collection of keys and values. This container can store multiple values for every key. | Documentation UnsafeMultiHashMap | Unordered associative array, a collection of keys and values, without any thread safety check features. This container can store multiple values for every key. | Documentation NativeStream | A deterministic data streaming supporting parallel reading and parallel writing. Allows you to write different types or arrays into a single stream. | Documentation UnsafeStream | A deterministic data streaming supporting parallel reading and parallel writings, without any thread safety check features. Allows you to write different types or arrays into a single stream. | Documentation NativeReference | An unmanaged, reference container. | Documentation UnsafeAppendBuffer | An unmanaged, untyped, buffer, without any thread safety check features. | Documentation UnsafeRingQueue | Fixed-size circular buffer, without any thread safety check features. | Documentation UnsafeAtomicCounter32 | 32-bit atomic counter. | Documentation UnsafeAtomicCounter64 | 64-bit atomic counter. | Documentation ... The items in this package build upon the NativeArray , NativeSlice , and other members of the Unity.Collections namespace, which Unity includes in the core module. Notation Native* container prefix signifies that containers have debug safety mechanisms which will warn users when a container is used incorrectly in regard with thread-safety, or memory management. Unsafe* containers do not provide those safety warnings, and the user is fully responsible to guarantee that code will execute correctly. Almost all Native* containers are implemented by using Unsafe* container of the same kind internally. In the release build, since debug safety mechanism is disabled, there should not be any significant performance difference between Unsafe* and Native* containers. Unsafe* containers are in Unity.Collections.LowLevel.Unsafe namespace, while Native* containers are in Unity.Collections namespace. Determinism Populating containers from parallel jobs is never deterministic, except when using NativeStream or UnsafeStream. If determinism is required, consider sorting the container as a separate step or post-process it on a single thread. Known Issues All containers allocated with Allocator.Temp on the same thread use a shared AtomicSafetyHandle instance. This is problematic when using NativeHashMap, NativeMultiHashMap, NativeHashSet and NativeList together in situations where their secondary safety handle is used. This means that operations that invalidate an enumerator for either of these collections (or the NativeArray returned by NativeList.AsArray) will also invalidate all other previously acquired enumerators. For example, this will throw when safety checks are enabled: var list = new NativeList<int>(Allocator.Temp); list.Add(1); // This array uses the secondary safety handle of the list, which is // shared between all Allocator.Temp allocations. var array = list.AsArray(); var list2 = new NativeHashSet<int>(Allocator.Temp); // This invalidates the secondary safety handle, which is also used // by the list above. list2.TryAdd(1); // This throws an InvalidOperationException because the shared safety // handle was invalidated. var x = array[0]; This defect will be addressed in a future release.

    "keywords": "About JetBrains Rider Editor The JetBrains Rider editor package integrates support for the JetBrains Rider .NET Integrated Development Environment (IDE), into the Unity Editor. This package provides an end-point for Rider to call different Unity APIs and to generate .csproj and .sln files, which Rider uses to implement support for Unity in its plug-in. This package ensures that IDE features like autocomplete suggestions and flagging dependency conflicts work in Rider. It uses .cproj and .sln files which store information about your project such as: Versioning information Build files Platform requirements Web server or database settings Not all code in Unity is directly visible to code editors, particularly when using packages. This is because packages don’t provide their own .csproj files, and Unity doesn’t create them for installed packages by default. This means that IDE features like autocomplete suggestions and flagging dependency conflicts do not work with code in these packages. The purpose of this package is to produce the .csproj files that make these features possible by default when you use Rider. Installation As of Unity version 2019.2, this package comes as a part of the default Unity installation. If you are updating your project from an older version of Unity, you might need to install this package via the Package Manager. Requirements This version of the JetBrains Rider editor package is compatible with the following versions of the Unity Editor: 2019.2.6 or later To use this package, you must have the following third-party products installed: JetBrains Rider version 2019.3 or newer For more information about the Rider IDE, see the JetBrains Rider documentation. Submitting issues This package is maintained by JetBrains and Unity. Submit issues to the JetBrains/resharper-unity/issues GitHub page. Unity intends for this package to become accessible to the public on GitHub in the future."

The Regenerate project files button updates existing .csproj files and creates the necessary new ones based on the settings you choose. These settings control whether to generate .csproj files for any installed packages. For more information on how to install packages, see the Adding and removing packages documentation. __ Embedded packages__ Any package that appears under your project’s Packages folder is an embedded package. An embedded package is not necessarily built-in; you can create your own packages and embed them inside your project. This setting is enabled by default. For more information on embedded packages, see the Embedded dependencies documentation. __ Local packages__ Any package that you install from a local repository stored on your machine, but from outside of your Unity project. This setting is enabled by default. __ Registry packages__ Any package that you install from either the official Unity registry or a custom registry. Packages in the Unity registry are available to install directly from the Package Manager. For more information about the Unity package registry, see the Package Registry section of the Unity Package Manager documentation. For information on creating and using custom registries in addition to the Unity registry, see the Scoped package registries documentation. __ Git packages__ Any package you install directly from a Git repository using a URL. __ Built-in packages__ Any package that is already installed as part of the default Unity installation. __ Tarball packages__ Any package you install from a GZip tarball archive on the local machine, outside of your Unity project. __ Unknown packages__ Any package which Unity cannot determine an origin for. This could be because the package doesn’t list its origin, or that Unity doesn’t recognize the origin listed. Player projects For each player project, generate an additional .csproj file named 'originalProjectName.Player.csproj'. This allows different project types to have their code included in Rider’s systems, such as assembly definitions or testing suites. This package also adds a second tab under Preferences named Rider, pictured below. Rider tab in the Preferences window Note The Logging Level menu does not control the level of Unity's logging, only the level of log messages that Rider package logs in its own log file. For more information on controlling Unity's logging level, see the Stack Trace Logging section of the Console Window documentation. Property: Description: Pass Console to Rider If Pass Console to Rider is enabled, Rider can access data that Unity sends to the Unity Console and display it within its own environment instead. Log file The Log file field contains an Open log button. Select this button to open the log file inside the Rider IDE. This button is unavailable when Logging Level is set to OFF. Logging Level The Logging Level menu controls how detailed are the Rider package logs. Those logs may be used for troubleshooting communication between Rider and Unity. Rider package logs all messages of the type you select as well as any messages of a more severe type. For example, if you choose WARN, then Rider logs all ERROR and FATAL messages as well as WARN messages. The message types are listed below in order of severity, with FATAL as the most severe type of message and TRACE as the least severe. OFF Rider does not produce any logs. **FATAL Logs information relating to serious problems that cause the application to crash. This setting produces the smallest logs. ERROR Logs information about errors that prevent some functionality from working, but don’t cause the application to fail (for example, a failed database connection). WARN Logs information about possible problems, or any unusual behaviour. Warnings don’t indicate that something has gone wrong, but that Unity detects something that might potentially cause an issue if not investigated. INFO Logs information about normal operation of the application, such as a successful database connection attempt. VERBOSE Logs detailed but not exhaustive information about your code. This setting is helpful for checking how your code executes or providing diagnostic information for other developers. TRACE Logs as much information about the application as possible. This can create a very large and detailed log, so it’s good practice to only use it when attempting to find the cause of a specific issue with your code."

When you select this option, the window reloads and displays settings that control production of .csproj files. Generate .csproj files Each setting in the table below enables or disables the production of .csproj files for a different type of package.When you click Regenerate project files, Unity updates the existing .csproj files and creates the necessary new ones based on the settings you choose. These settings control whether to generate .csproj files for any installed packages. For more information on how to install packages, see Adding and removing packages. Property Description Embedded packages Any package that appears under your project’s Packages folder is an embedded package. An embedded package is not necessarily built-in; you can create your own packages and embed them inside your project. This setting is enabled by default. For more information on embedded packages, see Embedded dependencies. Local packages Any package that you install from a local repository stored on your machine, but from outside of your Unity project. This setting is enabled by default. Registry packages Any package that you install from either the official Unity registry or a custom registry. Packages in the Unity registry are available to install directly from the Package Manager. For more information about the Unity package registry, see The Package Registry section of the Unity Package Manager documentation. For information on how to create and use custom registries in addition to the Unity registry, see Scoped package registries.

Changed Deprecated Removed Fixed Fixed documentation bug where quaternion.RotateX/Y/Z referred to a float4x4 instead of quaternion. Fixed code generation bugs which could cause Windows and Mac to generate different test code. Fixed some test asserts which used NaNs and signed zeros which failed in IL2CPP builds. Updated documentation for math.countbits() to include equivalent names on Intel and ARM architectures to aid in discoverability. Internal (Not ready for production) Added Unity.Mathematics.Geometry.Plane to represent planes in 3D space. Added more MinMaxAABB functionality from Unity.Physics.Aabb.

    "keywords": "Unity.Mathematics A C# math library providing vector types and math functions with a shader like syntax. Used by the Burst compiler to compile C#/IL to highly efficient native code. The main goal of this library is to provide a friendly Math API familiar to SIMD and graphic/shaders developers, using the well known float4, float3 types...etc. with all intrinsics functions provided by a static class math that can be imported easily into your C# program with using static Unity.Mathematics.math. In addition to this, the Burst compiler is able to recognize these types and provide the optimized SIMD type for the running CPU on all supported platforms (x64, ARMv7a...etc.) NOTICE: The API is a work in progress and we may introduce breaking changes (API and underlying behavior) Usage You can use this library in your Unity game by using the Package Manager and referencing the package com.unity.mathematics. See the forum Welcome page for more details. using static Unity.Mathematics.math; namespace MyNamespace { using Unity.Mathematics; ... var v1 = float3(1,2,3); var v2 = float3(4,5,6); v1 = normalize(v1); v2 = normalize(v2); var v3 = dot(v1, v2); ... } Building Open the src\\Unity.Mathematics.sln under Visual Studio 2015 or MonoDevelop and compile in Debug\\Release. Contributing We don't yet accept PR on this repository. See the FAQ below. The project is using editorconfig to keep files correctly formatted for EOL and spaces. We assume that your IDE has support for editorconfig, you can download the following extensions if your IDE is listed: VS2015/VS2017 EditorConfig extension Visual Studio Code EditorConfig extension SublimeText EditorConfig extension Frequently Asked Question Why developing another Math library instead of using existing Unity Vector3...etc.? After years of feedback and experience with the previous API, we believe that providing an API that is closer to the way graphics developers have been using math libraries should better help its adoption and the ease of its usage. HLSL / GLSL math library is a very well designed, well understood math library leading to greater consistency. Why not using System.Numerics.Vectors? Mainly for the reason mentioned above, System.Numerics.Vectors is in many ways similar to our previous Vector library (more object oriented than graphics programming oriented). Also the fact that our Burst compiler is able to recognize a lot more patterns for SIMD types and math intrinsics makes it easier to work with a dedicated API that reflects this ability. Naming convention In C# int and float are considered builtin types. Burst extends this set of bultin types to also include vectors, matrices and quaternions. These types are bultin in the sense that Burst knows about them and is be able to generate better code using these types than what would be possible with equivalent code using custom types. To signify that these types are bultin their type names are in all lower case. The operators on these bultin types found in Unity.Mathematics.math are considered intrinsics and are thus always in lower case. There are no plans to extend the set of intrinsic types beyond the current set of vectors (typeN), matrices (typeNxN) and quaternions (quaternion). This convention has the added benefit of making the library highly compatible with shader code and makes porting or sharing code between the two almost frictionless. Why can't we send a PR yet? We are working on providing a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) with a sign-over functionality and our UCL License doesn't cover this yet.

Updating com.unity.ext.nunit version Method marked with UnityTest that are not returning IEnumerator is now giving a proper error (DS-1059). [1.1.18] - 2020-10-07 Fixed issue of timeout during UnitySetUp which wasn't detected and allowed the test to pass instead of failing (case DSTR-21) [1.1.17] - 2020-10-05 Fixed an issue where the WaitForDomainReload yield instruction would sometimes let the test continue for one frame before the domain reload. Added support for negation in filters using !. E.g. !CategoryToExclude. Fixed an issue where if the first test enters PlayMode from UnitySetup then the test body will not run on consecutive runs (case 1260901). Clear Results button clears the test results in the GUI (DSTR-16) Improved UI in Test Runner window, added new options: Run Selected Tests in player Build/Export project with all tests in player Build/Export project with selected tests in player Fixed issue on loading EditMode or Playmode test tree in the wrong tab when switching between tabs when TestRunner is loading (DS-865) [1.1.16] - 2020-07-09 Follow up on fix when UTF picks up on outdated compilation errors [1.1.15] - 2020-07-02 Fixed an issue where an exception is thrown on getting the enumerator of a UnityTest would result in stopping the test run instead of failing it (case 1212000). Including a trailing semi-colon in a testName filter no longer results in all tests being run (case 1171200). Fixed and issue when Unity Test Framework exits editor on an outdated script compilation error (during api updates) [1.1.14] - 2020-04-03 Added the 'assemblyNames' command line argument for filtering on the assembly level. The dll and project level of the tree view should now correctly show the results when running tests in a player (case 1197026). Optimize usage of player connection when transfering test results (case 1229200). Ignore internal test framework tests assertions (case 1206961). [1.1.13] - 2020-03-16 Fixed an issue where a combination of Entering / Exiting playmode and recompiling scripts would result in the test run repeating (case 1213958). Fixed a regression from 1.1.12 where prefabs left in the scene would be cleaned up to aggressively. Fixed Test execution timed out. No activity received from the player in 600 seconds error when player is not supposed to start (case 1225147) [1.1.12] - 2020-03-02 Now 'Open error line' for a failed UTF test does not throw exceptions for corrupted testable pdb in Editor release mode (case 1118259) Fixed an issue where running a test fixture would also run other fixtures with the same full name (namespace plus classname) in other assemblies (case 1197385). Running tests with the same full name, with a domain reload inbetween, will no longer fail to initialize the fixture of the second class (case 1205240). Running a playmode tests with \"Maximize on Play\" will now correctly show the result of the tests in the test runner window (case 1014908).

Now ITestPlayerBuildModifier.ModifyOptions is called as expected when running tests on a device (case 1213845) [1.1.11] - 2020-01-16 Fixed test runner dlls got included into player build (case 1211624) Passing a non-full-path of XML file for -testResults in Unity Batchmode issue resolved, now passing \"result.xml\" creates the result file in the project file directory (case 959078) Respect Script Debugging build setting when running tests [1.1.10] - 2019-12-19 Introduced PostSuccessfulLaunchAction callback Fixed an issue where canceling a UnityTest while it was running would incorrectly mark it as passed instead of canceled. Added command line argument for running tests synchronously. The test search bar now handles null values correctly. The test output pane now retains its size on domain reloads. [1.1.9] - 2019-12-12 Rolled back refactoring to the test run system, as it caused issues in some corner cases. [1.1.8] - 2019-11-15 Ensured that a resumed test run is continued instantly. [1.1.7] - 2019-11-14 Fixed an issue with test runs after domain reload. [1.1.6] - 2019-11-12 Building a player for test will no longer look in unrelated assemblies for relevant attributes. [1.1.5] - 2019-10-23 Fixed a regression to synchronous runs introduced in 1.1.4. [1.1.4] - 2019-10-15 Running tests in batch mode now correctly returns error code 3 (RunError) when a timeout or a build error occurs. Fixed an issue where a test run in a player would time out, if the player takes longer than 10 minutes to run. Added command line argument and api setting for specifying custom heartbeat timeout for running on players. [1.1.3] - 2019-09-23 Fixed a regression where tests in a player would report a timeout after a test run is finished. Made it possible for the ui to change its test items when the test tree changes without script compilation. Added synchronous runs as an option to the TestRunnerApi. [1.1.2] - 2019-09-11 Fixed an issue where Run Selected would run all tests in the category, if a category filter was selected, regardless of what tests were selected. Unsupported attributes used in UnityTests now give an explicit error. Added support for the Repeat and Retry attributes in UnityTests (case 1131940). Tests with a explicit timeout higher than 10 minutes, no longer times out after running longer than 10 minutes when running from command line (case 1125991). Fixed a performance regression in the test runner api result reporting, introduced in 2018.3 (case 1109865). Fixed an issue where parameterized test fixtures would not run if selected in the test tree (case 1092244). Pressing Clear Results now also correctly clears the counters on the test list (case 1181763). Prebuild setup now handles errors logged with Debug.LogError and stops the run if any is logged (case 1115240). It now also supports LogAssert.Expect. [1.1.1] - 2019-08-07 Tests retrieved as a test list with the test runner api incorrectly showed both mode as their TestMode. Fixed a compatibility issue with running tests from rider. [1.1.0] - 2019-07-30 Introduced the TestRunnerApi for running tests programmatically from elsewhere inside the Editor. Introduced yield instructions for recompiling scripts and awaiting a domain reload in Edit Mode tests. Added a button to the Test Runner UI for clearing the results. [1.0.18] - 2019-07-15 Included new full documentation of the test framework.

Fixed a regression where playmode test application on the IOS platform would not quit after the tests are done. [1.0.16] - 2019-06-20 Fixed an issue where the Test Runner window popped out if it was docked, or if something else was docked next to it, when re-opened (case 1158961) Fixed a regression where the running standalone playmode tests from the ui would result in an error. [1.0.15] - 2019-06-18 Added new [TestMustExpectAllLogs] attribute, which automatically does LogAssert.NoUnexpectedReceived() at the end of affected tests. See docs for this attribute for more info on usage. Fixed a regression where no tests would be run if multiple filters are specified. E.g. selecting both a whole assembly and an individual test in the ui. Fixed an issue where performing Run Selected on a selected assembly would run all assemblies. Introduced the capability to do a split build and run, when running playmode tests on standalone devices. Fixed an error in ConditionalIgnore, if the condition were not set. [1.0.14] - 2019-05-27 Fixed issue preventing scene creation in IPrebuildSetup.Setup callback when running standalone playmode tests. Fixed an issue where test assemblies would sometimes not be ordered alphabetically. Added module references to the package for the required modules: imgui and jsonserialize. Added a ConditionalIgnore attribute to help ignoring tests only under specific conditions. Fixed a typo in the player test window (case 1148671). [1.0.13] - 2019-05-07 Fixed a regression where results from the player would no longer update correctly in the UI (case 1151147). [1.0.12] - 2019-04-16 Added specific unity release to the package information. [1.0.11] - 2019-04-10 Fixed a regression from 1.0.10 where test-started events were triggered multiple times after a domain reload. [1.0.10] - 2019-04-08 Fixed an issue where test-started events would not be fired correctly after a test performing a domain reload (case 1141530). The UI should correctly run tests inside a nested class, when that class is selected. All actions should now correctly display a prefix when reporting test result. E.g. \"TearDown :\". Errors logged with Debug.LogError in TearDowns now append the error, rather than overwriting the existing result (case 1114306). Incorrect implementations of IWrapTestMethod and IWrapSetUpTearDown now gives a meaningful error. Fixed a regression where the Test Framework would run TearDown in a base class before the inheriting class (case 1142553). Fixed a regression introduced in 1.0.9 where tests with the Explicit attribute could no longer be executed. [1.0.9] - 2019-03-27 Fixed an issue where a corrupt instance of the test runner window would block for a new being opened. Added the required modules to the list of package requirements. Fixed an issue where errors would happen if the test filter ui was clicked before the ui is done loading. Fix selecting items with duplicate names in test hierarchy of Test Runner window (case 987587). Fixed RecompileScripts instruction which we use in tests (case 1128994). Fixed an issue where using multiple filters on tests would sometimes give an incorrect result. [1.0.7] - 2019-03-12 This is the first release of Unity Package com.unity.test-framework. Migrated the test-framework from the current extension in unity."

With Edit Mode tests it is possible to test any of your Editor extensions using the UnityTest attribute. For Edit Mode tests, your test code runs in the EditorApplication.update callback loop. Note: You can also control entering and exiting Play Mode from your Edit Mode test. This allow your test to make changes before entering Play Mode. Edit Mode tests should meet one of the following conditions: They should have an assembly definition with reference to nunit.framework.dll and has only the Editor as a target platform: \"includePlatforms\": [ \"Editor\" ], Legacy condition: put tests in the project’s Editor folder. Play Mode tests You can run Play Mode tests as a standalone in a Player or inside the Editor. Play Mode tests allow you to exercise your game code, as the tests run as coroutines if marked with the UnityTest attribute. Play Mode tests should correspond to the following conditions: Have an assembly definition with reference to nunit.framework.dll. Have the test scripts located in a folder with the .asmdef file. The test assembly should reference an assembly within the code that you need to test. \"references\": [ \"NewAssembly\" ], \"optionalUnityReferences\": [ \"TestAssemblies\" ], \"includePlatforms\": [], Recommendations Attributes Use the NUnit Test attribute instead of the UnityTest attribute, unless you need to yield special instructions, in Edit Mode, or if you need to skip a frame or wait for a certain amount of time in Play Mode. References It is possible for your Test Assemblies to reference the test tools in UnityEngine.TestRunner and UnityEditor.TestRunner. The latter is only available in Edit Mode. You can specify these references in the Assembly Definition References on the Assembly Definition."

You can register callbacks by invoking RegisterCallbacks on the TestRunnerApi with an instance of a class that implements ICallbacks. There are four ICallbacks methods for the start and finish of both the whole run and each level of the test tree. Example An example of how listeners can be set up: Note: Listeners receive callbacks from all test runs, regardless of the registered TestRunnerApi for that instance. public void SetupListeners() { var api = ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<TestRunnerApi>(); api.RegisterCallbacks(new MyCallbacks()); } private class MyCallbacks : ICallbacks { public void RunStarted(ITestAdaptor testsToRun) { } public void RunFinished(ITestResultAdaptor result) { } public void TestStarted(ITestAdaptor test) { } public void TestFinished(ITestResultAdaptor result) { if (!result.HasChildren && result.ResultState != \"Passed\") { Debug.Log(string.Format(\"Test {0} {1}\", result.Test.Name, result.ResultState)); } } } Note: The registered callbacks are not persisted on domain reloads. So it is necessary to re-register the callback after a domain reloads, usually with InitializeOnLoad. It is possible to provide a priority as an integer as the second argument when registering a callback. This influences the invocation order of different callbacks. The default value is zero. It is also possible to provide RegisterCallbacks with a class instance that implements IErrorCallbacks that is an extended version of ICallbacks. IErrorCallbacks also has a callback method for OnError that invokes if the run fails to start, for example, due to compilation errors or if an IPrebuildSetup throws an exception."

Many of the fields allow for multiple values. The runner tries to match tests against at least one of the values provided and then runs any tests that match. Example In this example, the API runs tests with full names that fit either of the two names provided: var api = ScriptableObject.CreateInstance<TestRunnerApi>(); api.Execute(new ExecutionSettings(new Filter() { testNames = new[] {\"MyTestClass.NameOfMyTest\", \"SpecificTestFixture.NameOfAnotherTest\"} })); Multiple filter fields If using multiple different fields on the filter, then it matches against tests that fulfill all the different fields.

UTF uses a Unity integration of NUnit library, which is an open-source unit testing library for .Net languages. UTF currently uses NUnit version 3.5. For more information about NUnit, see the official NUnit website and the NUnit documentation. Note: UTF is not a new concept or toolset; it is an adjusted and more descriptive naming for the toolset otherwise known as Unity Test Runner, which is now available as this package. Installing Unity Test Framework To install this package, follow the instructions in the Package Manager documentation. Note: Search for the Test Framework package. In Unity 2019.2 and higher, you may need to enable the package before use. Using Unity Test Framework To learn how to use the Unity Test Framework package in your project, read the manual. Technical details Requirements This version of the Unity Test Framework is compatible with the following versions of the Unity Editor: 2019.2 and later. Known limitations Unity Test Framework version 1.0.18 includes the following known limitations: The UnityTest attribute does not support WSA platform. The UnityTest attribute does not support Parameterized tests (except for ValueSource). The UnityTest attribute does not support the NUnit Repeat attribute. Nested test fixture cannot run from the Editor UI. When using the NUnit Retry attribute in PlayMode tests, it throws InvalidCastException. Async tests are not supported in the current version of UTF.

Domain Reloads In Edit Mode tests it is possible to yield instructions that can result in a domain reload, such as entering or exiting Play Mode (see Custom yield instructions). When a domain reload happens, all non-Unity actions (such as OneTimeSetup and Setup) are rerun before the code, which initiated the domain reload, continues. Unity actions (such as UnitySetup) are not rerun. If the Unity action is the code that initiated the domain reload, then the rest of the code in the UnitySetup method runs after the domain reload."

As the implementation references the UnityEditor namespace, the code is typically implemented in an Editor only assembly, as the UnityEditor namespace is not available otherwise. Split build and run It is possible to use the Unity Editor for building the Player with tests, without running the tests. This allows for running the Player on e.g. another machine. In this case, it is necessary to modify the Player to build and implement a custom handling of the test result. By using TestPlayerBuildModifier, you can alter the BuildOptions to not start the Player after the build as well as build the Player at a specific location. Combined with PostBuildCleanup, you can automatically exit the Editor on completion of the build. Example using System; using System.IO; using System.Linq; using Tests; using UnityEditor; using UnityEditor.TestTools; using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.TestTools; [assembly:TestPlayerBuildModifier(typeof(HeadlessPlayModeSetup))] [assembly:PostBuildCleanup(typeof(HeadlessPlayModeSetup))] namespace Tests { public class HeadlessPlayModeSetup : ITestPlayerBuildModifier, IPostBuildCleanup { private static bool s_RunningPlayerTests; public BuildPlayerOptions ModifyOptions(BuildPlayerOptions playerOptions) { // Do not launch the player after the build completes. playerOptions.options &= ~BuildOptions.AutoRunPlayer; // Set the headlessBuildLocation to the output directory you desire. It does not need to be inside the project. var headlessBuildLocation = Path.GetFullPath(Path.Combine(Application.dataPath, \".//..//PlayModeTestPlayer\")); var fileName = Path.GetFileName(playerOptions.locationPathName); if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(fileName)) { headlessBuildLocation = Path.Combine(headlessBuildLocation, fileName); } playerOptions.locationPathName = headlessBuildLocation; // Instruct the cleanup to exit the Editor if the run came from the command line. // The variable is static because the cleanup is being invoked in a new instance of the class. s_RunningPlayerTests = true; return playerOptions; } public void Cleanup() { if (s_RunningPlayerTests && IsRunningTestsFromCommandLine()) { // Exit the Editor on the next update, allowing for other PostBuildCleanup steps to run. EditorApplication.update += () => { EditorApplication.Exit(0); }; } } private static bool IsRunningTestsFromCommandLine() { var commandLineArgs = Environment.GetCommandLineArgs(); return commandLineArgs.Any(value => value == \"-runTests\"); } } } If the Editor is still running after the Play Mode tests have run, the Player tries to report the results back, using PlayerConnection, which has a reference to the IP address of the Editor machine, when built. To implement a custom way of reporting the results of the test run, let one of the assemblies in the Player include a TestRunCallback. At RunFinished, it is possible to get the full test report as XML from the NUnit test result by calling result.ToXml(true). You can save the result and then save it on the device or send it to another machine as needed."

To do this, there is a TestRunCallback attribute which takes the type of ITestRunCallback implementation. You can invoke the callbacks with NUnit ITest and ITestResult classes. At the RunStarted and RunFinished methods, the test and test results are for the whole test tree. These methods invoke at each node in the test tree; first with the whole test assembly, then with the test class, and last with the test method. From these callbacks, it is possible to read the partial or the full results, and it is furthermore possible to save the XML version of the result for further processing or continuous integration.

    "keywords": "UnityTest attribute UnityTest attribute is the main addition to the standard NUnit library for the Unity Test Framework. This type of unit test allows you to skip a frame from within a test (so background tasks can finish) or give certain commands to the Unity Editor, such as performing a domain reload or entering Play Mode from an Edit Mode test. In Play Mode, the UnityTest attribute runs as a coroutine. Whereas Edit Mode tests run in the EditorApplication.update callback loop. The UnityTest attribute is, in fact, an alternative to the NUnit Test attribute, which allows yielding instructions back to the framework. Once the instruction is complete, the test run continues. If you yield return null, you skip a frame. That might be necessary to ensure that some changes do happen on the next iteration of either the EditorApplication.update loop or the game loop. Edit Mode example The most simple example of an Edit Mode test could be the one that yields null to skip the current frame and then continues to run: [UnityTest] public IEnumerator EditorUtility_WhenExecuted_ReturnsSuccess() { var utility = RunEditorUtilityInTheBackground(); while (utility.isRunning) { yield return null; } Assert.IsTrue(utility.isSuccess); } Play Mode example In Play Mode, a test runs as a coroutine attached to a MonoBehaviour. So all the yield instructions available in coroutines, are also available in your test. From a Play Mode test you can use one of Unity’s Yield Instructions: WaitForFixedUpdate: to ensure changes expected within the next cycle of physics calculations. WaitForSeconds: if you want to pause your test coroutine for a fixed amount of time. Be careful about creating long-running tests. The simplest example is to yield to WaitForFixedUpdate: [UnityTest] public IEnumerator GameObject_WithRigidBody_WillBeAffectedByPhysics() { var go = new GameObject(); go.AddComponent<Rigidbody>(); var originalPosition = go.transform.position.y; yield return new WaitForFixedUpdate(); Assert.AreNotEqual(originalPosition, go.transform.position.y); }"

For more information, see Unity Command line arguments. Test Framework command line arguments forgetProjectPath Don't save your current Project into the Unity launcher/hub history. runTests Runs tests in the Project. testCategory A semicolon-separated list of test categories to include in the run. A semi-colon separated list should be formatted as a string enclosed in quotation marks, e.g. testCategory \"firstCategory;secondCategory\". If using both testFilter and testCategory, then only tests that match both are run. This argument supports negation using '!'. If using '!MyCategory' then no tests with the 'MyCategory' category will be included in the run. testFilter A semicolon-separated list of test names to run, or a regular expression pattern to match tests by their full name. A semi-colon separated list should be formatted as a string enclosed in quotation marks, e.g. testFilter \"Low;Medium\". This argument supports negation using '!'. If using the test filter '!MyNamespace.Something.MyTest', then all tests except that test will be run. testPlatform The platform to run tests on. Accepted values: EditMode Edit Mode tests. Equivalent to running tests from the EditMode tab of the Test Runner window. PlayMode Play Mode tests that run in the Editor. Equivalent to running tests from the PlayMode tab of the Test Runner window. Any value from the BuildTarget enum. Play Mode tests that run on a player built for the specified platform.

A semi-colon separated list should be formatted as a string enclosed in quotation marks, e.g. assemblyNames \"firstAssembly;secondAssembly\". testResults The path where Unity should save the result file. By default, Unity saves it in the Project’s root folder. Test results follow the XML format as defined by NUnit, see the NUnit documentation. There is currently no common definition for exit codes reported by individual Unity components under test. The best way to understand the source of a problem is the content of error messages and stack traces. playerHeartbeatTimeout The time, in seconds, the editor should wait for heartbeats after starting a test run on a player.

    "keywords": "Setup and cleanup at build time In some cases, it is relevant to perform changes to Unity or the file system before building the tests. In the same way, it may be necessary to clean up such changes after the test run. In response to such needs, you can incorporate the pre-build setup and post-build cleanup concepts into your tests in one of the following ways: Via implementation of IPrebuildSetup and IPostBuildCleanup interfaces by a test class. Via applying the PrebuildSetup attribute and PostBuildCleanup attribute on your test class, one of the tests or the test assembly, providing a class name that implements the corresponding interface as an argument (fx [PrebuildSetup(\"MyTestSceneSetup\")]). Execution order All setups run in a deterministic order one after another. The first to run are the setups defined with attributes. Then any test class implementing the interface runs, in alphabetical order inside their namespace, which is the same order as the tests run. Note: Cleanup runs right away for a standalone test run, but only after related tests run in the Unity Editor. PrebuildSetup and PostBuildCleanup Both PrebuildSetup and PostBuildCleanup attributes run if the respective test or test class is in the current test run. The test is included either by running all tests or setting a filter that includes the test. If multiple tests reference the same pre-built setup or post-build cleanup, then it only runs once. IPrebuildSetup Implement this interface if you want to define a set of actions to run as a pre-build step. Public methods Syntax Description void Setup() Implement this method to call actions automatically before the build process. IPostBuildCleanup Implement this interface if you want to define a set of actions to execute as a post-build step. Cleanup runs right away for a standalone test run, but only after all the tests run within the Editor. Public methods Syntax Description void Cleanup() Implement this method to specify actions that should run as a post-build cleanup step. Example [TestFixture] public class CreateSpriteTest : IPrebuildSetup { Texture2D m_Texture; Sprite m_Sprite; public void Setup() { #if UNITY_EDITOR var spritePath = \"Assets/Resources/Circle.png\"; var ti = UnityEditor.AssetImporter.GetAtPath(spritePath) as UnityEditor.TextureImporter; ti.textureCompression = UnityEditor.TextureImporterCompression.Uncompressed; ti.SaveAndReimport(); #endif } [SetUp] public void SetUpTest() { m_Texture = Resources.Load<Texture2D>(\"Circle\"); } [Test] public void WhenNullTextureIsPassed_CreateShouldReturnNullSprite() { // Check with Valid Texture.

Start with switching to the PlayMode tab in the Test Runner window. Create a test assembly folder (see How to create a new test assembly). The folder name is Tests by default (or Tests 1, Tests 2, etc. if the preceding name is already in use). Note: If you don’t see the Create Play Mode Test Assembly Folder button enabled, make sure that in the Project window you navigate out of a folder with another .asmdef (such as one for Edit Mode tests). When you have your Play Mode test assembly folder ready, then create your Play Mode test. Note: Pre-defined Unity assemblies (such as Assembly-CSharp.dll) do not reference your new assembly. References and builds Unity Test Framework adds a reference to TestAssemblies in the Assembly Definition file but does not include any other references (e.g., to other scripting assemblies within the Unity project). To test other assemblies, you need to add them to the assembly definition yourself. For how to add assembly references, see Assembly Definition. We recommend putting tests into separate assemblies and using assembly definitions files. This way you will have more control over which assemblies need to reference test related dlls. Playmode build with TestsAssemblies Note: Enabling Play Mode tests for all assemblies includes additional assemblies in your project build, which can increase the project’s size as well as the build time. The supported workflow is to exclude TestAssemblies from Player builds. You can choose to enable playmode tests for all assemblies to run your tests inside the Editor, but this should be disabled again before building the Player to prevent build failures. To enable play mode tests for all assemblies you need to set the flag playModeTestRunnerEnabled to 1 inside the ProjectSettings/ProjectSetting.asset file in your project.

The Test Runner UI can help you set up TestAssemblies. Play Mode and Edit Mode tests need to be in separate assemblies. In the Test Runner window, you will see an EditMode tab enabled by default, as well as a Create EditMode Test Assembly Folder button. Click the button to create a Tests folder with a respective .asmdef file by default. Change the name of the new Assembly Definition, if necessary, and press Enter to accept it. In the Inspector window, it should have references to nunit.framework.dll*,* UnityEngine.TestRunner, and UnityEditor.TestRunner assemblies, as well as Editor preselected as a target platform.

    "keywords": "Workflow: How to create a test To create a test, do the following: Create your Test assembly folder and select it in the Project window. Click the button Create Test Script in current folder option in the Test Runner window. It creates a NewTestScript.cs file in the Tests folder. Change the name of the script, if necessary, and press Enter to accept it. Now you’ll see two sample tests in the Test Runner window: Now you can open the tests in your favorite script editor. You can also create test scripts by navigating to Assets > Create > Testing > C# Test Script, unless adding a test script would result in a compilation error. Note: Unity does not include TestAssemblies (NUnit, Unity Test Framework, and user script assemblies) when using the normal build pipeline, but does include them when using Run on <Platform> in the Test Runner window. Create additional tests To create another set of tests: In the Project window, select Assets. Create a new test assembly folder (menu: Assets > Create> Testing > Tests Assembly Folder). In the Project window, select the new folder. Create a new test script in the folder (menu: Assets > Create > Testing > C# Test Script). The assembly definition is assigned the same name as your new asset. To rename it, change the Name in the Insepctor window. Assembly definition names must be unique. Note: Changing the file name of the assembly definition file does not affect the value of the Name property in the file. Use the Inspector window to make sure the name is properly changed. By default Any Platform is preselected as the target platform for the new assembly, which means the test script appears as a PlayMode test in the TestRunner window. To change it to an EditMode test, in the Inspector window select Editor only under Platforms. New assemblies created through the Assets menu should automatically include references to UnityEngine.TestRunner and UnityEditor.TestRunner. If these references are missing, add them in the Inspector window under Assembly Definition References: Filters If you have a lot of tests, and you only want to view/run a sub-set of them, you can filter them in three ways (see image above): Type in the search box in the top left Click a test class or fixture (such as NewTestScript in the image above) Click one of the test result icon buttons in the top right For more information, see Edit Mode vs. Play Mode tests."

You can also run Play Mode tests on specific platforms. Click Run all in the player to build and run your tests on the currently active target platform. Note: Your current platform displays in brackets on the button. For example, in the image above, the button reads Run all in player (StandaloneWindows), because the current platform is Windows. The target platform is always the current Platform selected in Build Settings (menu: File > Build Settings). The test result displays in the build once the test completes: The application running on the platform reports back the test results to the Editor UI then displays the executed tests and shuts down. To make sure you receive the test results from the Player on your target platform back into the Editor that’s running the test, both should be on the same network. Note: Some platforms do not support shutting down the application with Application.Quit, so it will continue running after reporting the test results. If Unity cannot instantiate the connection, you can see the tests succeed in the running application. Running tests on platforms with arguments, in this state, does not provide XML test results.

Fixed potential issue when using Text Overflow Ellipsis and Truncate modes when the text contains characters using superscript, subscript or using the <voffset> tag. Revised culling of text objects when using a RectMask2D where the bounds of the text geometry instead of the RectTransform define the culling rect. Added HDR support to material preset colors. Fixed various formatting issues in this ChangeLog. Added the ability to define a unicode value for a missing sprite character in the TMP Settings. Added support for displaying a missing sprite character when the requested sprite character is not present in the sprite asset or potential fallback(s). This new functionality is only available when trying to reference a sprite by name. Sprite Characters will now have a default Unicode value of 0xFFFE (Private NonCharacter) instead of a Unicode value of 0x0 (default unicode value for missing character). Using the sprite asset context menu option \"Update Sprite Asset\" will now remap sprite characters with unicode value of 0x0 to 0xFFFE in addition to its currently functionality. Updating TMP Essential Resources via the \"Window - TextMeshPro - Import TMP Essential Resources\" menu option will no longer override existing TMP Settings. Minor optimization where SDF Scale on some text objects could be unnecessarily updated due to floating point rounding errors in their lossy scale.

Added Alpha Fade Speed property to the TMP_DropDown inspector. Minor improvements to the LogWarning related to missing characters in a font asset or fallback being replaced by a space character. Fixed text object geometry not getting clipped when object is outside of RectMask2D. Improved search for potential missing character to include the primary font asset and potential fallbacks when the current font asset is not the primary. Ignorable / Synthesized characters in font assets will only be created if they do not exist in the source font file. Trying to use Text Overflow Ellipsis mode when no Ellipsis character is available in the primary font asset or potential fallbacks will now issue a warning and switch Text Overflow mode to Truncate. Added &ltcolor=lightblue&gt and &ltcolor=grey&gt to pre-defined rich text tag colors. Fixed compatibility issue when using TexturePacker - JSON (Array) mode and the TMP Sprite Asset Importer to create SpriteAssets. Simple fix to prevent the underline rich text tag becoming visible in the TMP Input Field when in IME composition mode with Rich Text disabled on the TMP Input Field. This is a temporary fix until a more robust and flexible solution is implemented. Case #1219969 Sub Text Objects which are created when the text requires the use of a fallback font asset or sprite asset will now use HideFlags.DontSave to prevent them from being save with Prefabs as they are created on demand. Fix incorrect material reference when current font asset is not the primary or a fallback that is missing a character which is present in the primary font asset. [3.0.0-preview.7] - 2020-03-07 [2.1.0-preview.7] [1.5.0-preview.7] Changes Reverted recent change to the TMP_SubMeshUI OnDisable() function that could result in a Missing Reference Exception in the GraphicRaycaster.cs script. See the following forum post. Fixed glyph drawing issue in the Font Asset Inspector Glyph Adjustment Table when Multi Atlas Texture is enabled and the glyph is not located in the main atlas texture or at atlasTextures[0]. Added support for &ltZWSP&gt tag which is internally replaced by a zero width space or \\u200B. Improved line breaking handling when using &ltNBSP&gt and / or &ltNOBR&gt tags where instead of breaking these line segments per character, they will break at any possible soft breaking space when these segments exceed the width of the text container. Improved PreferredHeight calculations and handling when using Text Auto Size. Fixed incorrect color being applied to the underline or strikethrough line segments when using and / or tags along with a tag while at the same time applying an Underline or Strikethrough font style on the whole text object. Fixed SDF Scale not getting updated when using SetText() with StringBuilder when the lossyScale of the text object changes. Case #1216007 Added Non Breaking Space \\u00A0 and Soft Hyphen \\u00AD to list of synthesized characters in the event they are not present in the source font file. Fixed stack overflow issue when using TMP_FontAsset.HasCharacter and TMP_FontAsset.HasCharacters function on font assets that have circular fallback references. Case #1222574 Fixed atlas texture not getting set correctly to IsReadable when switching a static font asset to dynamic in the Generation Settings of the Font Asset Inspector. Added check for RectTransform.sizeDelta change when OnRectTransformDimensionsChange() is called by the Canvas system to get around potential rounding error that erroneously trigger this callback when the RectTransform is using Stretch Anchor mode. As requested by a few users, TMP_FontAsset.faceInfo setter is now public instead of internal. [3.0.0-preview.5] - 2020-02-25 [2.1.0-preview.5] [1.5.0-preview.5] Changes Revised SetText function formatting options to including ability to specify padding for integral part of the value. Revised format is as follows: {Arg Index:Integral Padding.Decimal Precision} Example: TMP_Text.SetText(\"Value = {0:000.00}\", 10.375f); result in \"Value = 010.38\". Fixed issue where text objects isTextObjectScaleStatic property would be ignored when OnCanvasHierarchyChanged() is called. Added a Character, Glyph and Record count to those respective tables in the Font Asset Inspector. Fixed potential Null Reference Exception that would occur when using text Overflow Ellipsis mode with a primary font asset that doesn't contain the Ellipsis character. Case #1209771 Fixed a potential Editor lockup when using text Overflow Page mode. Case #1219055 Fixed Input Field incorrect caret vertical alignment when using the Midline / Vertical Geometry alignment option. Added initial / minimal support for the New Input System. Please use with caution and report any issues. Changes to Font Asset Generation Settings via the Font Asset Inspector will now update the existing glyphs and characters for the new settings instead of clearing them. Text object InternalUpdate() used to handle potential scale changes of text objects now uses willRenderCanvases event instead of onPreCull. This avoids a potential one frame delay in updating of objects and no impact on objects. Case #1216007 [3.0.0-preview.4] - 2020-01-31 [2.1.0-preview.4] [1.5.0-preview.4] Changes Fixed Input Field issue where scrolling events could prevent OnEndEdit event from firing. See forum post for details. Improved Input Field handling of Vertical Scrollbar in conjunction with the ResetOnDeActivation property. Using the Vertical Scrollbar no longer triggers OnEndEdit event. Fixed potential Missing Component Exception that could occur when a TMP_SubMeshUI object is created. Fixed MissingReferenceException when deleting a TMP prefab that is part of a nested prefab. Case #1207793 Improved handling of allocations of newly created text objects with large amount of text. As a result of these revisions, allocations will potentially be reduce by 10X. See #1205923 Fixed potential Null Reference Exception with the TMP DropDown that could occur when using the experimental Editor \"Enter Play Mode\" feature. Case #1207915 Fixed potential issue with the assignment of sub text object materials. Add support for hiding the soft keyboard for Switch in the TMP Input Field. Fixed incorrect Preferred Height when Word Wrapping is disabled on text objects. See forum post for details. Added support for the new Selected state and color to the TMP Input Field. Case #1210496 Fixed additional instances of TMP Resource Importer window being created when deleting the \"TextMesh Pro\" folder just after having imported them. Case #1205848 Added public ITextPreprocessor textPreprocessor; property to allow setting the text preprocessor for a given text component. [3.0.0-preview.3] - 2019-12-16 [2.1.0-preview.3] [1.5.0-preview.3] Changes Fixed potential issue with TMP Dropdown where calling Show() and Hide() in very short interval could result in additional Blockers. Case #1194114 Fixed potential issues that could occur when upgrading to version 1.5.0-preview.2 or newer of the TMP package without also updating the TMP Essential Resources in the project. Added check and warning when trying to create a font asset whose source font file has \"Incl. Font Data\" disabled in the Font Import Settings.

Case #1197614 Fixed Font Asset Creator issue where too many adjustment records with adjustment value of zero were added to the font asset. Added support for Line Separator \\u2028 and Paragraph Separator \\u2029. TMP shaders have been moved from \"TextMesh Pro/Resources/Shaders\" folder to \"TextMesh Pro/Shaders\" folder. See the following post for details. Added new experimental SDF and Mobile SDF Shaders that use Screen Space Derivatives (SSD) where these shaders no longer require SDF Scale to be passed via Vertex Attributes. These shaders have higher performance overhead but are more flexible. This overhead should only be noticeable on mobile platforms. Fixed potential text alignment issue where upgrading from package version 1.4.1 to 1.5.0-preview.2 would result in incorrect alignment on prefabs. Case #1198833 Added \\u061C Arabic Letter Mark, \\u200E Left-to-Right Mark and \\u200F Right-to-Left Mark to list of control and non renderable characters. Fixed Missing Reference Exception that would appear when expanding the Extra Settings of a TextMeshPro Preset asset. Case #1201072 Fixed Missing Reference Exception that would appear when editing the Vertex Color or Color Gradient of a TMP component Preset asset.

Case #1189820 Fixed Fallback material not getting updated correctly when changing Generation Settings on the Fallback Font Asset. Fixed a typo in the Font Weight section of the Font Asset Editor. Fixed potential ArgumentOutOfRangeException in the Input Field when using Hide Mobile Input and deleting a long string. Case #1162514 Added \"Is Scale Static\" option in the Extra Settings to exclude text objects from InternalUpdate callbacks to improve performance when the object's scale is static. This InternalUpdate callback is used to track potential changes to the scale of text objects to update their SDF Scale. Added the ability to control culling modes for the TMP Shaders. This new option is available in the Debug section of the Material Inspector. New feature requires updating the TMP Essential Resources. See the following post https://forum.unity.com/threads/not-see-textmeshpro-rendering-from-the-back.767510/#post-5112461.

Revised the ForceMeshUpdate() function as follows: public void ForceMeshUpdate(bool ignoreActiveState = false, bool forceTextReparsing = false). Fixed SubMeshUI objects text disappearing when saving a scene. Creating Material Presets via the Material Context menu with multi selection will now work as expected and assign the newly created material preset to all selected text objects. Fixed minor issue when changing Material Preset in prefab isolation mode with multiple text objects selected where the new material preset would not be assigned to disabled text objects. Revised Character, Word, Line and Paragraph spacing adjustments to be in font units (em) where a value of 1 represents 1/100 em. Added TMP_Text.onFontAssetRequest and TMP_Text.onSpriteAssetRequest events to allow users to implement custom asset loading when using the &ltfont=\"Font Asset Name\"&gt and &ltsprite=\"Sprite Asset Name\"&gt tags. Additional Shader Channels on the Canvas will be set to TexCoord1, Normal and Tangents or Mixed when using TMP Surface Shaders. Otherwise it will be set to TexCoord1 only. Case #1100696 Added new attribute to the &ltmark&gt tag to allow users to define a padding value for the mark / highlight region. Example: &ltmark color=#FFFF0080 padding=\"1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0\"&gt where padding=\"Left, Right, Top, Bottom\".

Also added example scene in the TMP Examples & Extras. Added the ability to define Face Info metrics per Sprite Assets. This will provide for more consistent scaling of the sprites regardless of the font asset used. Sprite Assets with undefined Face Info will continue to inherit the Face Info metrics of the current font asset. Added Update Sprite Asset option in the header of the Sprite Asset inspector. This increases the discoverability of this option already available via the Sprite Asset Context Menu. Revised the text auto-sizing handling in regards to maximum iteration threshold which could result in a crash on some Android devices. Case #1141328 Font Asset Generation Settings are now disabled in the inspector if the Source Font File is missing or if the Atlas Population Mode is set to static. Fixed vertical alignment issue when using Overflow Page mode. Improved handling of text auto-size line adjustment spacing resulting in fewer iterations and more accurate resulting point size. Added support for Layout Elements to the TMP Input Field. = Fixed text alignment issue with TMP Input Field when using Center alignment on the underlying text component. Setting ContentType.Custom on the TMP Input Field will no longer hide the Soft Keyboard. The Soft Keyboard can now be control independently via the shouldHideSoftKeyboard property. Added new Font Asset Context Menu option \"Force Upgrade To Version 1.1.0\" for convenience purposes in case a font asset didn't get upgraded automatically when migrating from version 1.3.0 to 1.4.x or 2.0.x. The &ltgradient&gt tag now as an optional attribute \"tint=0\" or \"tint=1\" controlling whether or not the gradient will be affect by vertex color. The alpha of the gradient will continue to be affected by the vertex color alpha. Added new angle=x attribute to the &lti&gt tag where the value of x define the italic slant angle. Since the legacy TextContainer used by TMP has been deprecated, it was removed from the Layout Context Menu options. Improved character positioning when using italic text where large angle / slant would potentially result in uneven spacing between normal and italic blocks of text. Fixed an issue where &ltmspace&gt and &ltcspace&gt tags would not be handled correctly in conjunction with word wrapping. Fixed issue in the TMP_Dropdown.cs that was affecting navigation. Case 1162600. See https://forum.unity.com/threads/huge-bug-missing-a-code-line-since-1-4-0.693421/ Fixed an issue related to kerning where the glyph adjustment values did not account for the upsampling of the legacy SDF modes like SDF8 / SDF16 and SDF32. Made the TMP_Text.text property virtual. Fixed Material Preset of fallback materials getting modified when the TMP Settings Match Material Preset option is disabled. Added ShaderUtilities.ID_GlowInner to list of material property IDs.

Fixed text horizontal alignment when lines of text only contain the Ellipsis \\u2026 Unicode character. Case #1162685 Text alignment is now serialized into separate fields for horizontal and vertical alignment and can now be get / set independently via TMP_Text.horizontalAlignment and TMP_Text.verticalAlignment. The TMP_Text.alignment property remains and uses the new serialized fields for horizontal and vertical alignment. Improved handling of Soft Hyphens when using Text Auto-Size. Fixed Null character being passed to Validate method of the TMP_InputField. Case #1172102 Fixed an issue where the Preferred Width and Height were not correct when using Tabs. The Cull Transparent Mesh flag on TMP_SubMeshUI objects will now mirror the settings on the parent text object's CanvasRenderer. Updated Sprite Importer to improve compatibility with Texture Packer Json Array export format. Newly created StyleSheets will be pinged in the project tab. Case #1182117 Added new option in the TMP Settings to control line breaking rules for Hangul to enabled Modern line breaking or traditional line breaking. Fixed potential issue related to SDF Scaling when the scale of the text object is negative.

The \"Allow Rich Text Editing\" property of the TMP_InputField is now set to false by default. Added new option to the Sprite Asset context menu to make it easier to update sprite glyphs edited via the Unity Sprite Editor. Added new Sharpness slider in the Debug section of the SDF Material inspector. Fixed an error that would occur when using the context menu Reset on text component. Case #1044726 Fixed issue where CharacterInfo.index would be incorrect as a result of using Surrogate Pairs in the text. Case #1037828 The TMP_EditorPanel and TMP_UiEditorPanel now have their \"UseForChildren\" flag set to true to enable user / custom inspectors to inherit from them. Fixed an issue where rich text tags using pixel (px) or font units (em) were not correctly accounting for orthographic camera mode. This change only affects the normal TMP text component. Fixed an inspector issue related to changes to the margin in the TMP Extra Settings panel. Case #1114253 Added new property to Glyph Adjustment Pairs which determines if Character Spacing Adjustments should affect the given pair. Updated the Glyph Adjustment Table where ID now represents the unicode (hex) value for the character instead of its decimal value. Added new SetValueWithoutNotify() function to TMP_DropDown and SetTextWithoutNotify() function to TMP_InputField allowing these to be set without triggering OnValueChanged event. Geometry buffer deallocation which normally takes place when current allocations exceed those of the new text by more than 256 characters will no longer occur if the new text is set to null or string.empty.

Using TMP_Text.SetCharArray() with an empty char[] array will now clear the text. Made a small improvement to the TMP Input Field when using nested 2d RectMasks. Renamed symbol defines used by TMP to append TMP_ in front of the define to avoid potential conflicts with user defines. Improved the Project Files GUID Remapping tool to allow specifying a target folder to scan. Added the ability to cancel the scanning process used by the Project Files GUID Remapping tool. Moved TMP Settings to universal settings window in 2018.3 and above. Changing style sheet in the TMP Settings will now be reflected automatically on existing text objects in the editor. Added new function TMP_StyleSheet.UpdateStyleSheet() to update the internal reference to which style sheet text objects should be using in conjunction with the style tag. [1.2.4] - 2018-06-10 Changes Fixed a minor issue when using Justified and Flush alignment in conjunction with \\u00A0. The Font Asset creationSettings field is no longer an Editor only serialized field. [1.2.3] - 2018-05-29 Changes Added new bitmap shader with support for Custom Font Atlas texture. This shader also includes a new property \"Padding\" to provide control over the geometry padding to closely fit a modified / custom font atlas texture. Fixed an issue with ForceMeshUpdate(bool ignoreActiveState) not being handled correctly. Cleaned up memory allocations from repeated use of the Font Asset Creator. Sprites are now scaled based on the current font instead of the primary font asset assigned to the text object. It is now possible to recall the most recent settings used when creating a font asset in the Font Asset Creator. Newly created font assets now contain the settings used when they were last created. This will make the process of updating / regenerating font assets much easier. New context menu \"Update Font Asset\" was added to the Font Asset inspector which will open the Font Asset Creator with the most recently used settings for that font asset. New Context Menu \"Create Font Asset\" was added to the Font inspector panel which will open the Font Asset Creator with this source font file already selected. Fixed 3 compiler warnings that would appear when using .Net 4.x. Modified the TMP Settings to place the Missing Glyph options in their own section. Renamed a symbol used for internal debugging to avoid potential conflicts with other user project defines. TMP Sprite Importer \"Create Sprite Asset\" and \"Save Sprite Asset\" options are disabled unless a Sprite Data Source, Import Format and Sprite Texture Atlas are provided.

Users will now be prompted to import the TMP Essential Resources when using the Font Asset Creator if such resources have not already been imported. [1.2.2] - 2018-03-28 Changes Calling SetAllDirty() on a TMP text component will now force a regeneration of the text object including re-parsing of the text. Fixed potential Null Reference Exception that could occur when assigning a new fallback font asset. Removed public from test classes. Fixed an issue where using nested links (which doesn't make sense conceptually) would result in an error. Should accidental use of nested links occurs, the last / most nested ends up being used. Fixed a potential text alignment issue where an hyphen at the end of a line followed by a new line containing a single word too long to fit the text container would result in miss alignment of the hyphen. Updated package license. Non-Breaking Space character (0xA0) will now be excluded from word spacing adjustments when using Justified or Flush text alignment. Improved handling of Underline, Strikethrough and Mark tag with regards to vertex color and Color tag alpha. Improved TMP_FontAsset.HasCharacter(char character, bool searchFallbacks) to include a recursive search of fallbacks as well as TMP Settings fallback list and default font asset. The &ltgradient&gt tag will now also apply to sprites provided the sprite tint attribute is set to a value of 1. Ex. &ltsprite=\"Sprite Asset\" index=0 tint=1&gt. Updated Font Asset Creator Plugin to allow for cancellation of the font asset generation process. Added callback to support the Scriptable Render Pipeline (SRP) with the normal TextMeshPro component. Improved handling of some non-breaking space characters which should not be ignored at the end of a line. Sprite Asset fallbacks will now be searched when using the &ltsprite&gt tag and referencing a sprite by Unicode or by Name. Updated EmojiOne samples from https://www.emojione.com/ and added attribution. Removed the 32bit versions of the TMP Plugins used by the Font Asset Creator since the Unity Editor is now only available as 64bit. The isTextTruncated property is now serialized. Added new event handler to the TMP_TextEventHandler.cs script included in Example 12a to allow tracking of interactions with Sprites. [1.2.1] - 2018-02-14 Changes Package is now backwards compatible with Unity 2018.1. Renamed Assembly Definitions (.asmdef) to new UPM package conventions. Added DisplayName for TMP UPM package. Revised Editor and Playmode tests to ignore / skip over the tests if the required resources are not present in the project. Revised implementation of Font Asset Creator progress bar to use Unity's EditorGUI.ProgressBar instead of custom texture. Fixed an issue where using the material tag in conjunction with fallback font assets was not handled correctly. Fixed an issue where changing the fontStyle property in conjunction with using alternative typefaces / font weights would not correctly trigger a regeneration of the text object. [1.2.0] - 2018-01-23 Changes Package version # increased to 1.2.0 which is the first release for Unity 2018.2. [1.1.0] - 2018-01-23 Changes Package version # increased to 1.1.0 which is the first release for Unity 2018.1. [1.0.27] - 2018-01-16 Changes Fixed an issue where setting the TMP_InputField.text property to null would result in an error. Fixed issue with Raycast Target state not getting serialized properly when saving / reloading a scene. Changed reference to PrefabUtility.GetPrefabParent() to PrefabUtility.GetCorrespondingObjectFromSource() to reflect public API change in 2018.2 Option to import package essential resources will only be presented to users when accessing a TMP component or the TMP Settings file via the project menu. [1.0.26] - 2018-01-10 Added Removed Tizen player references in the TMP_InputField as the Tizen player is no longer supported as of Unity 2018.1. [1.0.25] - 2018-01-05 Added Fixed a minor issue with PreferredValues calculation in conjunction with using text auto-sizing. Improved Kerning handling where it is now possible to define positional adjustments for the first and second glyph in the pair. Renamed Kerning Info Table to Glyph Adjustment Table to better reflect the added functionality of this table. Added Search toolbar to the Glyph Adjustment Table. Fixed incorrect detection / handling of Asset Serialization mode in the Project Conversion Utility. Removed SelectionBase attribute from TMP components. Revised TMP Shaders to support the new UNITY_UI_CLIP_RECT shader keyword which can provide a performance improvement of up to 30% on some devices. Added TMP_PRESENT define as per the request of several third party asset publishers. [1.0.23] - 2017-11-14 Added New menu option added to Import Examples and additional content like Font Assets, Materials Presets, etc for TextMesh Pro.

    "keywords": "TextMesh Pro User Guide Overview This User Guide was designed to provide first time users of TextMesh Pro with a basic overview of the features and functionality of the tool. Installation The TextMesh Pro UPM package is already included with the Unity Editor and as such does not require installation. TextMesh Pro \"TMP\" does however require adding resources to your project which are essential for using TextMesh Pro. To import the \"TMP Essential Resources\", please use the \"Window -> TextMeshPro -> Import TMP Essential Resources\" menu option. These resources will be added at the root of your project in the \"TextMesh Pro\" folder. The TextMesh Pro package also includes additional resources and examples that will make discovering and learning about TextMesh Pro's powerful features easier. It is strongly recommended that first time users import these additional resources. To import the \"TMP Examples & Extras\", please use the \"Window -> TextMeshPro -> Import TMP Examples & Extras\" menu option. These resources will also be added in the same \"TextMesh Pro\" folder inside your project. Quick Start There are two TextMesh Pro components available. The first TMP text component is of type <TextMeshPro> and designed to work with the MeshRenderer. This component is an ideal replacement for the legacy TextMesh component. To add a new <TextMeshPro> text object, go to: �GameObject->3D Object->TextMeshPro Text�. The second TMP text component is of type <TextMeshProUGUI> and designed to work with the CanvasRenderer and Canvas system. This component is an ideal replacement for the UI.Text component. To add a new <TextMeshProUGUI> text object, go to: �GameObject->UI->TextMeshPro Text�. You may also wish to watch this Getting Started short video which covers this topic. We strongly recommend that you also watch the Font Asset Creation video as well as the Working with Material Presets as these two topics is also key to working and getting the most out of TextMesh Pro. As mentionned in the Installation section of this guide, it is recommended that you import the \"TMP Examples & Extras\" and take the time to explore each of the examples as they provide a great overview of the functionality of the tool and the many text layout and rich text tags available in TextMesh Pro. Support & API Documentation Should you have questions or require assistance, please visit the Unity UI & TextMesh Pro section of the Unity forum as well as the TextMesh Pro User Forum where you will find additional information, Video Tutorials and FAQ. In the event you are unable to find the information you seek, always feel free to post on the Unity UI & TextMesh Pro section user forum. Online Documentation is also available on TextMesh Pro including Rich Text tags, Shaders, Scripting API and more."

    "keywords": "Clip Edit modes and the Clips view Use the Clips view to add, position, and manipulate clips on each track in the Track list. The selected Clip Edit mode determines how clips interact when you add, move, or delete them. The Clip Edit modes (green) and the Clips view (red) Clips and the Clips view In the Clips view, each clip has a colored accent line that identifies the type of clip: Activation clips are green. Animation clips are blue. Audio clips are orange. Control clips are turquoise. Playable clips are white. A clip based on data, such as an Animation clip or an Audio clip, displays arrows that indicate when the clip has been trimmed to exclude part of its source animation, waveform, or other data. For example, if an Animation clip uses only part of its full key animation, white arrows indicate that key animation exists before the start or after the end of the clip. Small arrows (circled) indicate that data exists before the start or after the end of the area defined by the clip To resize a clip and view its hidden data, either right-click the clip and select Match Content from the context menu, or select the clip and modify its clip timing properties in the Inspector window. When you resize a clip, the selected Clip Edit mode determines how the surrounding clips are affected. Clip Edit modes Select a Clip Edit mode to choose how clips are added, positioned, and trimmed within the Clips view, or when modifying clip timing properties in the Inspector window. There are three Clip Edit modes that affect most clip editing features: Mix mode (default), Ripple mode, and Replace mode. Clip Edit modes are Mix (default and selected), Ripple, and Replace mode You can also temporarily switch between Clip Edit modes. This is useful if, for example, you want to temporarily use Ripple mode to offset the content of a track while you position clips. To temporarily switch between Clip Edit modes, hold down the following keyboard keys: Hold 1 to temporarily switch to Mix mode. Hold 2 to temporarily switch to Ripple mode. Hold 3 to temporarily switch to Replace mode. Mix mode Use Mix mode to add, position, and trim clips without moving or replacing adjacent clips. Mix mode creates blends between intersecting clips. Mix mode is the default Clip Edit mode. Timeline window with Mix mode as the selected Clip Edit mode. The position cursor (circled) indicates where you drag to position the clip. In Mix mode, when you hover over a selected clip in the Clips view, the cursor changes to indicate the action that you can perform. The action depends on the part of the clip that you hover over: When you hover over the start of a selected clip, the cursor changes to a trim cursor. The trim cursor indicates the area to drag to trim the start of the clip. When you hover over the middle of a selected clip, the cursor changes to a position cursor and indicates the area to drag to position the clip. When you hover over the end of a selected clip, the cursor changes to a trim cursor. The trim cursor indicates the area to drag to trim the end of the clip. In Mix mode, if you drag to trim or position a clip and it intersects another clip, the cursor changes to a white arrow that points towards the blend being created. There are three possible cursors depending on whether the blend is created at the beginning of the clip, at the end of the clip, or at both the beginning and end of the clip. The white arrow cursor indicates that dragging Clip 2A to the right creates a blend, at the end of the clip, between Clip 2A and Clip 2B. Ripple mode Use Ripple mode to add, position, and trim a clip while affecting the subsequent clips on the same track. Positioning or trimming clips in Ripple mode preserves the gaps between subsequent clips. Timeline window with Ripple mode as the selected Clip Edit mode. The position cursor (circled) indicates where you drag to position the clip. In Ripple mode, when you hover over a selected clip in the Clips view, the cursor changes to indicate the action that you can perform. The actions and areas are similar to Mix mode: When you hover over the start of a selected clip, the cursor changes to a trim cursor. The trim cursor indicates the area to drag to trim the clip relative to its start. When you hover over the middle of a clip, the cursor changes to a position cursor and indicates the area to drag to position the clip. When you hover over the end of a clip, the cursor changes to a trim cursor. The trim cursor indicates the area to drag to trim the clip relative to its end. In Ripple mode, when you click and drag to trim or position a clip, the cursor switches to a yellow arrow that points towards the affected clips and gaps. A yellow line indicates the ripple point. When you drag to trim a clip, dragging left and right changes the duration of the selected clip and repositions subsequent clips and gaps after the ripple point. For example, the yellow arrow cursor indicates that trimming the start of Clip 2A in Ripple mode changes the clip duration and affects the clips and gaps after the ripple point: Clip 2B and Clip 2C.] Replace mode Use Replace mode to add, position, and trim a clip while cutting or replacing intersecting clips. Timeline window with Replace mode as the selected Clip Edit mode. The position cursor (circled) indicates where you drag to position the clip. In Replace mode, when you hover over a selected clip in the Clips view, the cursor changes to indicate the action that you can perform. The actions and areas are similar to Mix mode: When you hover over the start of a selected clip, the cursor changes to a trim cursor. The trim cursor indicates the area to drag to trim the clip relative to its start. When you hover over the middle of a clip, the cursor changes to a position cursor and indicates the area to drag to position the clip. When you hover over the end of a clip, the cursor changes to a trim cursor. The trim cursor indicates the area to drag to trim the clip relative to its end. In Replace mode, when you drag to position a clip, the clip becomes translucent so that you can view overlapping clips. If the clip being positioned overlaps other clips, the cursor changes to a red arrow and red replacement lines indicate where each overlap occurs. Releasing the clip cuts the underlying clip at each red overlap. For example, the red arrow cursor indicates that dragging Clip 2A to the right overlaps Clip 2B. Releasing the clip cuts Clip 2B at the point where the overlap occurs. In Replace mode, trimming a clip is similar to positioning a clip. When you drag to trim a clip and it intersects another clip, the cursor changes to a red arrow and a red replacement line indicates where the overlap occurs. Releasing the trim cuts the intersecting clip at the red replacement line."

This automatically creates a Control track and adds a Control clip for the Prefab instance. Drag a GameObject with a Particle component to add a particle effect to your Timeline instance. This automatically creates a Control track and adds a Control clip for the duration of the Particle effect. When you add a clip, the selected Clip Edit mode determines how the added clip interacts with surrounding clips. For example, if you add an Animation clip or an Audio clip in Mix mode and the added clip intersects a clip on the same track, Timeline creates a blend."

To create an ease-in or ease-out transition, select a clip and, in the Inspector window, set either the Ease In Duration or the Ease Out Duration. Use Ease In Duration and Ease Out Duration to smoothly transition into and out of the selected clip. Ease-in and ease-out transitions create different effects, depending on the track: On an Animation track or an Animation Override track, ease-in to an Animation clip to create a smooth transition between the animation in the gap before the clip and the Animation clip. Ease-out of an Animation clip to create a smooth transition between the Animation clip and the animation in the gap after the clip. For information on the factors that determine what animation occurs in the gap before and after an Animation clip, see Setting gap extrapolation. On an Audio track, ease-in to an Audio clip to fade in the volume of the audio waveform. Ease-out of an Audio clip to fade out the volume of the audio waveform specified by the Audio clip. On a Playable track, ease-In to a Playable clip to fade in the effect or script in the Playable clip. Ease-out of a Playable clip to fade out the effect or script in the Playable clip. Ease-in and ease-out an Animation clip to transition between its animation and its gaps. Timeline represents ease-in and ease-out transitions as a linear curve. Although the Clips view represents an ease-in or ease-out transition as a single linear curve, every ease-in or ease-out transition is actually set to a gradually easing-in or easing-out curve by default. To change the shape of either the ease-in curve (labelled In) or the ease-out (labelled Out) curve, use the Blend Curves in the Inspector window. Use the Blend Curves to customize ease-in or ease-out transitions Note that the Blend Curves might affect the blend area used for blending between two clips. The Ease In Duration and Ease Out Duration properties indicate whether the Blend Curves affect an ease-in or ease-out transition, or a blend. For example, If the Ease Out Duration is editable, then the Blend Out curve (labelled Out) affects the curve used by an ease-out transition. If the Ease Out Duration is not editable, then the Blend Out curve (labelled Out) affects the outgoing clip in a blend between two clips. Ease Out Duration is not editable, therefore the Out curve affects the blend area between two clips To customize either the ease-in or ease-out transition, use the drop-down menu to switch from Auto to Manual. With Manual selected, the Inspector window shows a preview of the blend curve. Click the curve preview to open the Curve Editor below the Inspector window. Select Manual and click the preview to open the Curve Editor The Curve Editor is the same editor that is used to customize the shape of the blend curves when blending between clips. When creating an ease-in or an ease-out transition with Animation clips, the Animation clip blends between its gaps and the Animation clip. The following factors affect the values of animated properties in the gaps surrounding an Animation clip: The pre-extrapolate and post-extrapolate settings for the Animation clip and for other Animation clips on the same track. Animation clips on other Animation tracks that are bound to the same GameObject. The position or animation of the GameObject in the Scene, outside the Timeline Asset. Gap extrapolation and easing clips To successfully ease-in or ease-out an Animation clip, gap extrapolation must not be set based on the Animation clip being eased-in or eased-out. Gap extrapolation must either be set to None or set by another Animation clip. For example, the following ease-in transition has no effect because the Pre-Extrapolate for the Victory_Dance clip is set to Hold. This means that the ease-in creates a transition between the first frame of the Animation clip and the rest of the Animation clip. The gap is set to Hold from the Animation clip (circled). The ease-in transition has no effect. To ease-in from the Idle clip, set pre-extrapolate for the Victory_Dance clip to None. The ease-in gap uses the post-extrapolate mode from the Idle clip (circled). Overriding Animation tracks with ease-in and ease-out transitions Use two Animation tracks bound to the same GameObject to create a smooth transition between two Animation clips. For example, if two Animation tracks are bound to the same GameObject and a clip on the second track contains an ease-in transition, the ease-in transition creates a smooth transition between the animation on the previous track and the animation on the second track. Example of using two Animation tracks, bound to the same GameObject, to create smooth transitions between Animation clips. In this example, the Animation clip on the first track is a repeated idle cycle where the humanoid GameObject stands still. The Animation clip in the second track eases-in the Victory_Dance motion and eases-out to return back to the idle cycle To successfully override animation on a previous track, the gap extrapolation for the second track must be set to None so that the animation data in the gap is taken from the previous track bound to the same GameObject. The ease-in and ease-out transitions use this animation data."

    "title": "Setting gap extrapolation | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Setting gap extrapolation Gap extrapolation refers to how an Animation track approximates animation data in the gaps before and after an Animation clip. The main purpose for extrapolating animation data in the gaps between Animation clips is to avoid animation anomalies. Depending on the GameObject bound to the Animation track, these anomalies could be a GameObject jumping between two transformations, or a humanoid jumping between different poses. Each Animation clip has two gap extrapolation properties: Pre-Extrapolate, which controls how animation data is approximated in the gap before an Animation clip, and Post-Extrapolate, which controls how animation data extends in the gap after an Animation clip. By default, Timeline sets both extrapolation properties to Hold. This sets the gap before the Animation clip to the animation on the first frame, and the gap after the Animation clip to the animation on the last frame. Each gap \"holds\" the animation at a certain frame. Icons before and after an Animation clip indicate the selected extrapolation modes. Icons indicate the pre-extrapolate and post-extrapolate modes When an Animation track contains a gap between two Animation clips, the Post-Extrapolate property of the left clip sets the gap extrapolation. If the Post-Extrapolate property of the clip to the left of a gap is set to None, the Pre-Extrapolate property of the right clip sets the gap extrapolation. Icons before and after Animation clips indicate whether the extrapolation for a gap is taken from the Post-Extrapolate property of the clip to the left or from the Pre-Extrapolate property of the clip to the right. First track (red box): gap extrapolation from Post-Extrapolate of the left clip. Third track (blue box): gap extrapolation from Pre-Extrapolate of the right clip. To change the Pre-Extrapolate and Post-Extrapolate properties, select the Animation clip and use the Animation Extrapolation properties in the Inspector window. Use Pre-Extrapolate and Post-Extrapolate to set the extrapolation modes for the selected Animation clip The Pre-Extrapolate property is hidden when one of the following is true: The gap before the Animation clip is set by the Post-Extrapolation mode of the previous clip. There is no gap before the Animation clip. Use the Pre-Extrapolation property to set the gap extrapolation of the gap before the selected Animation clip to one of the following options: None: Turns off pre-extrapolation. In the gap before the selected Animation clip, the GameObject uses its transform, pose, or state from the Scene. Select None if, for example, you want to create an ease-in between the motion of a GameObject in the Scene and an Animation clip. See Easing-in and Easing-out Clips for details. Hold (default): In the gap before the selected Animation clip, the GameObject bound to the Animation track uses the values assigned at the start of the Animation clip. Loop: In the gap before the selected Animation clip, the GameObject bound to the Animation track repeats the entire animation as a forward loop: from start to end. To offset the start of the loop, use the Clip In property. Ping Pong: In the gap before the selected Animation clip, the GameObject bound to the Animation track repeats the entire animation forwards, then backwards. Use the Clip In property to offset the start of the loop. Changing the Clip In property affects the start of the loop when looping forward, and the end of the loop when looping backwards. Continue: In the gap before the selected Animation clip, the GameObject bound to the Animation track either holds or loops the animation based on the settings of the Source Asset. For example, if the selected Animation clip uses the motion file \"Recorded(2)\" as its Source Asset and \"Recorded(2)\" is set to Loop, then selecting Continue loops the animation according to the \"Recorded(2)\" Loop Time settings. Use the Post-Extrapolate property to set the gap extrapolation of the gap after the selected Animation clip to one of the following options: None: Turns off post-extrapolation. In the gap after the selected Animation clip, the GameObject uses its transform, pose, or state from the Scene. Selecting None is useful if, for example, you want to create an ease-out between an Animation clip and the motion of a GameObject in the Scene. See Easing-in and Easing-out Clips for details. Hold (default): In the gap after the selected Animation clip, the GameObject bound to the Animation track uses the values assigned at the end of the Animation clip. Loop: In the gap after the selected Animation clip, the GameObject bound to the Animation track repeats the entire animation as a forward loop: from start to end. To offset the start of the loop, use the Clip In property. Ping Pong: In the gap after the selected Animation clip, the GameObject bound to the Animation track repeats the entire animation forwards, then backwards. Use the Clip In property to offset the start of the loop. Changing the Clip In property affects the start of the loop when looping forward, and the end of the loop when looping backwards. Continue: In the gap after the selected Animation clip, the GameObject bound to the Animation track either holds or loops the animation based on the settings of the Source Asset. For example, if the selected Animation clip uses the motion file \"Recorded(2)\" as its Source Asset and \"Recorded(2)\" is set to Loop, then selecting Continue loops the animation according to the \"Recorded(2)\" Loop Time settings."

    "keywords": "Inserting clips The Timeline window supports different methods of inserting clips depending on the type of track, where you click, and whether a clip or track is already selected. In the Timeline window, inserting clips refers to adding and making space for a clip without blending or replacing intersecting clips. To accurately insert a clip, select Ripple mode as the Clip Edit mode, and position the Timeline Playhead to set the insertion point. Select Add From Animation Clip from the Track menu for the track where you want to insert the clip. Accurately insert a clip with the Ripple mode (red circle), the Timeline Playhead (green box), and the Add From Animation Clip in the Track menu In the above example, the Timeline Playhead is the insertion point. You can specify the insertion point using these other methods: Right-click within a gap and add a clip with the context menu. The insertion point is where you right-click. Drag a Source Asset (animation or audio) to a track in the Clips view. The insertion point is where you stop dragging. The location of the insertion point determines where the clip is inserted and how it affects the other clips and gaps on the same track: If the insertion point intersects a clip, the inserted clip is added at the insertion point. The intersected clip, and all subsequent clips and gaps, are rippled after the inserted clip. If the insertion point is within a gap and there is enough space between the insertion point and the next clip, then the inserted clip is added to the gap. The other clips on the track are not affected. If the insertion point is within a gap and the inserted clip overlaps the next clip, the inserted clips is added at the insertion point. The next clip, and all subsequent clips and gaps, are rippled to accommodate the inserted clip. For example, inserting a clip at the Timeline Playhead ripples Clip 1B to accommodate the 36 frame Run clip."

    "keywords": "Matching clip offsets Every Animation clip contains key animation, or motion, that animates the GameObject, or humanoid, bound to the Animation track. When you add an Animation clip to an Animation track, its key animation or motion does not automatically begin where the previous clip ends. The key animation or motion also does not end where the next clip begins. By default, each Animation clip begins at the position and rotation of the GameObject, or humanoid, at the beginning of the Timeline instance. An animation sequence of three Animation clips. For example, three Animation clips create an animation sequence that starts with a clip of a standing humanoid that starts to run, then turns left, and finally comes to a stand still. Each Animation clip begins at the position and rotation of the humanoid at the start of the Timeline instance, indicated by a red arrow in the Scene view below. The three Animation clips, Stand2Run, RunLeft, and Run2Stand, end at the green, blue, and yellow arrows, respectively. For an animation sequence to flow seamlessly between adjacent Animation clips, you must match each Animation clip with its previous clip or next clip. Matching clips adds a position and rotation offset for each Animation clip. The position and rotation offsets are named Clip Transform Offsets and they can be set manually or automatically. The following sections describe how to automatically match two or many Animation clips. Matching two clips To match the clip offsets between two clips, right-click the Animation clip that you want to match. From the context menu, select either Match Offsets to Previous Clip or Match Offsets to Next Clip. Matching an Animation clip with the next clip For example, right-click the middle Animation clip, named \"RunLeft\", and select Match Offsets To Next Clip to match its offsets to the next clip When you are matching offsets for a single Animation clip, you don’t need to select the Animation clip first, but you must right-click the Animation clip that you want to match. For example, if you right-click an Animation clip that is not selected, Timeline matches the clicked clip and ignores the selected Animation clips. The context menu only displays the match options available for the clicked Animation clip. For example, if there is a gap before the clicked Animation clip, only the Match Offsets to Next Clip menu item is available. Matching many clips To match the clip offsets of many clips, select the adjacent Animation clips that you want to match and right-click one of the selected clips. From the context menu, select either Match Offsets to Previous Clip or Match Offsets to Next Clip. Matching many clips with previous clips For example, select the \"RunLeft\" and \"Run2Stand\" clips. Right-click one of the selected clips, and select Match Offsets to Previous Clips, to match the \"RunLeft\" clip with the previous \"Stand2Run\" clip, and to match \"Run2Stand\" with the previous \"RunLeft\" clip."

Positioning clips in Ripple mode ripples subsequent clips, respecting the gaps between clips. Positioning clips in Replace mode cuts or replaces intersecting clips. Positioning clips with the Timeline Playhead You can position clips by inserting frames at the position of the Timeline Playhead. To do this, move the Timeline Playhead to where you want to insert frames. To insert frames starting at frame 40, move the Timeline Playhead to frame 40 Right-click the Timeline Playhead on the Timeline ruler above the Clips view, choose Insert > Frame, and a number of frames. To insert 25 frames, right-click the Timeline Playhead and select Insert > Frame, then 25 Frames This inserts frames in the Timeline Asset at the position of the Timeline Playhead. Inserting frames only repositions the clips that start after the position of the Timeline Playhead. Only the clips that start after the Timeline Playhead are moved.

For example, an Animation clip named \"End Move\" uses the motion file \"Recorded(2)\" as its Source Asset. The motion file \"Recorded(2)\" is set to loop. Trimming the end of the Animation clip past the end of the \"Recorded(2)\" Source Asset fills the extra clip area by looping \"Recorded(2)\". A white animation curve shows the hold or loop. A white animation curve indicates whether the extra clip area holds or loops data, depending on the Source Asset To choose whether the extra clip area holds or loops, select the Source Asset to change its settings in the Inspector window.

These special trim options either remove the last partial loop or complete the last partial loop. For example, the Animation clip named run_away is over three times longer than the Source Asset on which it is based. Since the Source Asset is set to loop, the Animation clip loops the Source Asset until the Animation clip ends which results in a partial loop. L1, L2, and L3 signify complete loops.

The term interpolation refers to the estimation of values that determine the shape of the animation curve between two keys. Whether a key has one of two tangents depends on the location of the key on the animation curve. The first key only has a right tangent that controls the interpolation of the animation curve after the key. The last key only has a left tangent that controls the interpolation of the animation curve before the last key. The first key (red) only has a right tangent, and the last key (blue) only has a left tangent All other keys have two tangents where the left tangent controls the interpolation before the key, and the right tangent controls the interpolation after the key. By default, tangents are joined. Dragging one tangent affects the position of both tangents, and the interpolation of the animation curve both before and after the key. Keys that are neither the first key nor last key have joined tangents by default. Dragging either tangent changes the interpolation of the animation curve both before and after the key. Dragging a tangent may also change the interpolation mode of the animation curve. For example, most keys are set to the Clamped Auto interpolation mode which automatically smooths animation curve as it passes through the key. If you drag a tangent of a key set to Clamped Auto, the interpolation mode changes to Free Smooth. The term interpolation mode refers to the interpolation algorithm that determines which shape to use when drawing the animation curve. To view the interpolation mode for a key, select the key and right-click. The context menu shows the interpolation mode. To change the interpolation mode for a key, select the key, right-click and select another interpolation mode. The context menu shows the interpolation mode for the selected key. Use the context menu to change the interpolation mode. Some interpolation modes break the left and right tangents so that you can position them separately. When tangents are broken, you can set a separate interpolation mode for the animation curve before the key and the animation curve after the key. For more details on the different interpolation modes, see Editing Curves. In the Animation window documentation, the interpolation mode is referred to as tangent type."

This section documents the properties in the Inspector window that appear when you select one or many Timeline Assets, tracks, clips, or a combination. If you select a single Timeline Asset, track, or clip, the Inspector window displays the properties for the selected Asset, track, or clip. For example, if you select an Animation clip, the Inspector window shows the common properties and Playable Asset properties for the selected Animation clip. Inspector window when selecting an Animation clip in the Timeline window If you select multiple Timeline Assets, tracks, or clips, the Inspector window shows two sections: a section with properties that apply to the entire selection, and a section of common properties that apply to each selected object individually. For example, if you select an Audio clip on one track and two Animation clips on another track, the Inspector window includes Multiple Clip Timing properties and Clip Timing properties: Use the Multiple Clip Timing properties to change the Start or End of the selection as a group. For example, if you change the Start to frame 30, the selection of clips start at frame 30. This moves the start of the first clip to frame 30 and the remaining selected clips are placed relative to the first clip, respecting gaps between selected clips. Use the Clip Timing properties to change the common properties for each selected clip. If the selected clips have different values for the same property, the value is represented with a dash (\"-\"). If you change the dash to a value, it sets the value for all selected clips. For example, if you change the Ease In Duration from a dash to 10 frames, the ease in of each selected clip changes to 10 frames. Inspector window when selecting multiple clips, on multiple tracks, in the Timeline window If your selection does not have common properties, the Inspector window prompts you to narrow the selection. For example, if you select an Animation track and an Audio clip in the Timeline window, you are prompted to narrow the selection: The message in the Inspector window when the selection does not have common properties"

The body parts that are masked are animated by other Animation tracks in the Timeline Asset. For example, you can use an Avatar Mask to combine the lower-body animation on an Animation track with the upper body animation on an Override Animation track. Default Offset Match Fields Expand to display a series of checkboxes that choose which transforms are matched when matching clip offsets between Animation clips. The Default Offset Match Fields set the default matching options for all Animation clips on the same track. Use the Animation Playable Asset properties to override these defaults for each Animation clip."

    "keywords": "Playable Director component The Playable Director component stores the link between a Timeline instance and a Timeline Asset. The Playable Director component controls when the Timeline instance plays, how the Timeline instance updates its clock, and what happens when the Timeline instance finishes playing. Playable Director component added to the GameObject named Ground. The GameObject is associated with the GroundCTL Timeline Asset. The Playable Director component also shows the list of tracks from the associated Timeline Asset (Playable property) that animate GameObjects in the Scene. The link between Timeline Asset tracks and GameObjects in the Scene is referred to as binding or Track binding. For more on binding and the relationship between Timeline Assets and Timeline instances, see Timeline overview. Property Description Playable Associates a Timeline Asset with a GameObject in the Scene. When you make this association, you create a Timeline instance for the selected Timeline Asset. After you create a Timeline instance, you can use the other properties in the Playable Director component to control the instance and choose which GameObjects in the Scene are animated by the Timeline Asset. Update Method Sets the clock source that the Timeline instance uses to update its timing. DSP Select for sample accurate audio scheduling. When selected, the Timeline instance uses the same clock source that processes audio. DSP stands for digital signal processing. Game Time Select to use the same clock source as the game clock. This clock source is affected by time scaling. Unscaled Game Time Select to use the same clock source as the game clock, but without being affected by time scaling. Manual Select to not use a clock source and to manually set the clock time through scripting. Play on Awake Whether the Timeline instance is played when game play is initiated. By default, a Timeline instance is set to begin as soon as the Scene begins playback. To disable the default behaviour, disable the Play on Awake option in the Playable Director component. Wrap Mode The behaviour when the Timeline instance ends playback. Hold Plays the Timeline instance once and holds on the last frame until playback is interrupted. Loop Plays the Timeline instance repeatedly until playback is interrupted. None Plays the Timeline instance once. Initial Time The time (in seconds) at which the Timeline instance begins playing. The Initial Time adds a delay in seconds before the Timeline instance actually begins. For example, when Play On Awake is enabled and Initial Time is set to five seconds, if you click the Play button in the Unity Toolbar, Play Mode starts and the Timeline instance begins five seconds later. Current Time Views the progression of time according to the Timeline instance in the Timeline window. The Current Time field matches the Playhead Location field. Use the Current Time field when the Timeline window is hidden. The Current Time field appears in the Playable Director Component when in Timeline Playback mode or when Unity is in Game Mode. Bindings Shows the link between GameObjects in the Scene with tracks from the associated Timeline Asset (Playable property). The Bindings area is split into two columns: The first column lists the tracks from the Timeline Asset. Each track is identified by an icon and its track type. The second column lists the GameObject linked (or bound) to each track. The Bindings area does not list Track groups, Track sub-groups, or tracks that do not animate GameObjects. The Timeline window shows the same bindings in the Track list."

    "keywords": "Samples Gameplay Sequence Demo This sample demonstrates how Timeline can be used to create a small in-game moment, using built-in tracks. Overview In this example, we have a Player character jogging and then colliding with another character. The Player character represents our gameplay character and is using a looping jog animation. The Timeline then takes control of the player character, collides with the other character, then returns to his original gameplay animation (jog) once the Timeline has finished. Note that the gameplay animation is driven by an Animator and will only play at runtime. The character will be in a T-Stance pose for the runtime portion when using the Timeline preview. Timeline Structure This sample uses the following tracks: Activation, Animation, Audio, Control and Marker track. The GameplaySequence timeline has been organized in the following groups: Building, Lights, Cameras, Characters, Audio and Props. Building group This group contains two Control tracks: Building Spawn which spawns the building prefab, and Building Particles that controls two particle systems in the scene (ElectricalSparks and SandSwirlsEffect). Lights group This group contains two Animation tracks; one for the Sun light, and the other for the flickering light. Both tracks where animated in Unity and the curves can be seen by enabling the curves icon or double clicking on the track to open the Animation window. Sun light is animated in Rotation (sunrise) and the Point light has a spiked Intensity curve. Cameras group This group contains two cameras: Main camera using an Animation track, and Follow camera using an Activation track. Main Camera has an animation curve for the continuous movement (which can be seen by enabling the curves icon) and two override tracks, one for each character. The clips on the override tracks have static values for a fixed camera shot. Follow camera is simply parented child of the Player character's root and activated for the follow-cam shots. Characters group The first track is an Animation track for the Playercharacter. Notice that clip pre and post extrapolations are set to None, meaning the character will not be influenced by the timeline during these gaps. At runtime, these gaps mean the Player character will be using his Animator state, jog. The second track is an Activation track for the second character, making his appear in the scene. The third and last track is an Animation track for the second character. On this track, the second character blends from one clip to another creating a cinematic sequence. Audio group This group contains four Audio tracks; Player, crickets, neon-light & character2. The Player track has a jog/breathing and bump clip. The crickets track has pan and volume animation curves (can be seen by enabling the curves icon). The neon-light sound is for the flickering Point light. The Character2 tracks contains all audio clips for this second character. Props group This group animates Table and Can. The first Activation track makes Table appear in the scene. The second Activation track makes a static version of Can appear in the scene. The third track is an Animation track that animates the table bump animation. The last track is a Control track with a sub-timeline for the can animation. The static version of the can is disabled and replaced with the animated version when the Control clip starts. Double-clicking the Control track clip will enter the Can sub-timeline. Can Sub-Timeline This sub-timeline contains an Animation track for the can rolling off the table and bouncing on the ground, an Audio track for the sounds effects and a Control track for the liquid particles splashing out of the can. Marker track In the Timeline window, under the time ruler, there is a Marker track with one Signal at frame 1200. This is the Signal marker that triggers the jog audio clip on Player once the timeline finishes the gameplay jog. Customization samples This sample includes tracks, clips, markers and actions that demonstrate how to extend and customize timeline in different ways. Annotation: provides a marker that can be used as a bookmark. Video track: provides a track capable of playing video clips. Time dilation track: provides a track that can be used to adjust Unity's global Time.timeScale. Tween track: provides a track that can be used for simple transform movements. Text track: provides a track that can be used to display different messages to the screen using a TextMeshPro Text component. Demo Included is a demo timeline that showcases all the of the above samples."

    "title": "Annotation marker sample | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Annotation marker sample The Annotation sample provides a marker that can be used as a bookmark for your timeline. Here are the options available on an annotation: Field | Description --- | --- Title | The annotation's title. This will be displayed as a tooltip, when hovering the mouse on the annotation. Color | The annotation's color in the Timeline window. Show line overlay | Use this option to show a vertical line that spans the full height of the Timeline window. Custom marker workflow example This example will demonstrate how to: create a custom marker; customize a marker with MarkerEditor; use a custom USS style to draw a marker; add additional commands with Actions; 1. Create an annotation marker A marker is an item that can be added to a Timeline Asset and is used to represent a point in time. Markers also have a specialization, just like clips (Activation clip, Audio clip, Animation clip, etc). In order to add a new type of marker, all we need to do is to create a class that inherits the Marker class: public class AnnotationMarker : UnityEngine.Timeline.Marker {} This custom marker can now be added to any track or on the timeline marker area: We can add a title, description and color to the annotation: public class AnnotationMarker : Marker { public string title; public Color color; public string description; public bool showLineOverlay; } The annotation marker itself is now complete. But the customization work is not done yet. Timeline offers many customization abilities. 2. Customize the marker's appearance A marker's appearance can be customized using a USS style or with MarkerEditor. Both paths have their advantages and drawbacks. Custom USS style A marker can use a USS style to specify its appearance. For more information on how to create custom USS styles, see how to define custom USS styles. The CustomStyle attribute can be used to specify a style for a given marker: [CustomStyle(\"AnnotationStyle\")] public class AnnotationMarker : Marker { //... } AnnotationStyle is defined in a USS stylesheet and will be used when a marker is displayed on screen: USS styles are useful if the desired appearance is simple (i.e. when only using a texture icon). For more complex stuff (i.e. dynamically changing a marker's color), a MarkerEditor will be needed. Custom editor MarkerEditor can be used to augment the capabilities of a marker in the editor. It works like a custom Inspector; the CustomTimelineEditor attribute is used to tell Timeline that a MarkerEditor class should be associated to a given marker. [CustomTimelineEditor(typeof(AnnotationMarker))] public class AnnotationMarkerEditor : MarkerEditor { //... } Marker information MarkerEditor lets us provide information about the marker by overriding the GetMarkerOptions method. public override MarkerDrawOptions GetMarkerOptions(IMarker marker) { var annotation = marker as AnnotationMarker; if (annotation != null) { return new MarkerDrawOptions { tooltip = annotation.title }; } return base.GetMarkerOptions(marker); } Here the tooltip of an Annotation has been set to use the annotation's title variable. MarkerDrawOptions can also set the error text on a marker, which can be useful if a variable has been incorrectly set and needs attention. Overlay An overlay can be drawn on top of a marker by overriding the DrawOverlay method: public override void DrawOverlay(IMarker marker, MarkerUIStates uiState, MarkerOverlayRegion region) { var annotation = marker as AnnotationMarker; if (annotation != null) { //Draw overlay code... } } An overlay is drawn on top of the marker; the USS style is drawn first and DrawOverlay is called afterwards. For an Annotation, we can use DrawOverlay to change the color of the marker and to draw a line that spans the full Timeline window's height. To do this, we can use the information given in region. Along with the visible time range, MarkerOverlayRegion provides two rectangles that can be used to know where to draw: markerRegion markerRegion is the rectangle that encompasses the marker. This is useful to draw something directly on the marker itself. For Annotation, this rectangle is used to draw the color overlay. timelineRegion timelineRegion is the rectangle that encompasses the clips and markers region of the timeline window. This is useful to draw something out of the marker's region, like the Annotation's line overlay. const float k_LineOverlayWidth = 6.0f; float markerRegionCenter = markerRegion.xMin + (markerRegion.width - k_LineOverlayWidth) / 2.0f; Rect lineRect = new Rect(markerRegionCenter, timelineRegion.y, k_LineOverlayWidth, timelineRegion.height); 3. Create custom Actions Timeline Action Actions can be used to add new menu entries in Timeline's context menus. For an Annotation, we want to add a menu item available in all context menus to create an Annotation with the clipboard's contents. To do this, a TimelineAction is needed, along with the MenuEntry attribute. [MenuEntry(\"Create Annotation from clipboard contents\")] public class CreateAnnotationFromClipboardContents : TimelineAction { //... } MenuEntry lets Timeline know that this action can be added in context menus. Classes inheriting from TimelineAction need to override two methods: Execute and Validate. Validate Validate is used to specify that the action's prerequisites are fulfilled. In the case of CreateAnnotationFromClipboardContents, the action is only valid if there actually is contents in the clipboard. ActionValidity is used to describe the validity state of an action: public override ActionValidity Validate(ActionContext context) { if (!markers.All(marker => marker is AnnotationMarker)) return ActionValidity.NotApplicable; string buffer = EditorGUIUtility.systemCopyBuffer; return buffer.Length == 0 ? ActionValidity.Invalid : ActionValidity.Valid; } ActionValidity.Valid : The action can be executed. ActionValidity.Invalid : The action cannot be executed given the current context and will appear grayed out in context menus. ActionValidity.NotApplicable : The action does not apply to the current context and will not show up in menus. Execute Execute should run the code necessary to execute the action's purpose. public override bool Execute(ActionContext context) { string buffer = EditorGUIUtility.systemCopyBuffer; TrackAsset track = context.tracks.FirstOrDefault(); if (buffer.Length != 0) { // Create the new annotation and add it to the track //... return true; } return false; } The return value should specify if the execution succeeded or not. Marker Action It is also possible to write custom actions that apply only to markers, instead of all Timeline items. This is the purpose of the MarkerEditor class. It works just like TimelineAction, except that action applies to a list of markers. A shortcut can also be assigned to an action. A static method with the TimelineShortcut attribute is needed. Invoker can be used to easily execute a given action: [TimelineShortcut(\"Replace annotation description with clipboard\", KeyCode.G)] public static void InvokeAction() { Invoker.InvokeWithSelectedMarkers<ReplaceAnnotationDescriptionAction>(); } Notes Runtime considerations AnnotationMarker is available at runtime; it can be queried using, for example, TrackAsset.GetMarkers(). However, AnnotationMarkerEditor and custom actions are not available at runtime, since it depends on classes that are not part of the runtime assembly."

All translation happens in a straight line but the speed can be controlled with an animation curve. The Tween track binds to the scene Transform you wish to move. Field Description Start Location This is a reference to a Transform in the scene that marks the position and/or rotation of the moving Transform when the playable starts. If it is left null the position/rotation of the moving Transform when the playable starts will be used. End Location This is a reference to a Transform in the scene that marks the position and/or rotation of the moving Transform when the playable finishes. Tween Position Whether or not the position of the Transform should change. Tween Rotation Whether or not the rotation of the Transform should change. Custom clip workflow example This example will demonstrate how to: create a custom clip, track and mixer; use the PlayableGraph API to animate an object's transform; customize a clip with ClipEditor; 1. Custom clip when a Timeline begins playing, nodes called Playables are created. They are organized in a tree-like structure called the PlayableGraph. For each frame, Timeline samples this graph to read and mix multiple data sources (animation, audio and more). The first step to create a custom clip is to define a new PlayableBehaviour that will be added to a graph. It will need to store the data needed to implement the transform tween: public class TweenBehaviour : PlayableBehaviour { public Transform startLocation; public Transform endLocation; public bool shouldTweenPosition; public bool shouldTweenRotation; public AnimationCurve curve; } The PlayableBehaviour's data is not serialized and will be lost once its parent graph is destroyed. To save this data, the next step is to define a new PlayableAsset: [Serializable] public class TweenClip : PlayableAsset { public ExposedReference<Transform> startLocation; public ExposedReference<Transform> endLocation; public bool shouldTweenPosition = true; public bool shouldTweenRotation = true; public AnimationCurve curve; //... } Note: The clip needs to store a start and an end location. Since an asset cannot directly reference a scene object, it cannot store a transform object directly. This is why an ExposedReference<Transform> is used. A PlayableAsset's main purpose is to build a PlayableBehaviour. This is done with the CreatePlayable method: public class TweenClip : PlayableAsset { //... public override Playable CreatePlayable(PlayableGraph graph, GameObject owner) { // create a new TweenBehaviour ScriptPlayable<TweenBehaviour> playable = ScriptPlayable<TweenBehaviour>.Create(graph); TweenBehaviour tween = playable.GetBehaviour(); // set the behaviour's data tween.startLocation = startLocation.Resolve(graph.GetResolver()); tween.endLocation = endLocation.Resolve(graph.GetResolver()); tween.curve = curve; tween.shouldTweenPosition = shouldTweenPosition; tween.shouldTweenRotation = shouldTweenRotation; return playable; } } CreatePlayable will initialize a new TweenBehaviour using TweenClip's data. 2. Custom track A custom track is created by defining a TrackAsset subclass. The following attributes can be added to a TrackAsset: TrackBindingType: defines which type of object should be bound to a track; TrackClipType: defines which type of clip should be associated to a track. For this example, the track needs a Transform object binding and can only accepts clips of type TweenClip, which was previously defined in step 1: [TrackBindingType(typeof(Transform))] [TrackClipType(typeof(TweenClip))] public class TweenTrack : TrackAsset { // ... } The data setup is complete; TweenTrack and TweenClip can now be added to a timeline: However, no transform tween has been implemented yet. To do this, a track mixer is needed. 3. Define a track mixer To properly handle blending, or crossfading, between two clips, a track mixer is needed. A track mixer is a PlayableBehaviour that will have access to all clips data and will blend those together. Track mixer setup By default, when a track is added to a timeline, an empty playable is generated and is connected to each clip's playable. For example, this track: will generate the following playable graph: Timeline: this playable is the root playable; all playables related to tracks are connected to this node. Playable: this playable represents the track mixer. Since no track mixer is defined, an empty one is generated. TweenBehaviour: this playable represents a clip. One per clip is generated. All clip playables are connected to the track mixer. In order to define a custom track mixer, a new PlayableBehaviour needs to be defined: public class TweenMixerBehaviour : PlayableBehaviour {} then, in TrackAsset, the CreateTrackMixer method can be used to specify a custom track mixer: public class TweenTrack : TrackAsset { public override Playable CreateTrackMixer(PlayableGraph graph, GameObject go, int inputCount) { return ScriptPlayable<TweenMixerBehaviour>.Create(graph, inputCount); } } Now the playable graph looks like this: The empty playable that used to connect clip playables together is now replaced by TweenMixerBehaviour. Transform tween implementation The implementation of the transform tween resides in the ProcessFrame method from TweenMixerBehaviour. Here are the main steps of that implementation: Initialization: When the timeline is first played, the initial transform of the track binding is fetched. If the start or end transform is null, the initial transform will be used instead. Get clip behaviours & weights: to appropriately blend, the mixer needs to ask information for all of its inputs (clips): // Iterate on all the playable's (mixer) inputs (ie each clip on the track) int inputCount = playable.GetInputCount(); for (int i = 0; i < inputCount; i++) { // get the input connected to the mixer Playable input = playable.GetInput(i); // get the weight of the connection float inputWeight = playable.GetInputWeight(i); // get the clip's behaviour TweenBehaviour tweenInput = GetTweenBehaviour(input); } Calculate and blend: A linear interpolation is used to calculate a transform between two points. Apply result: Once the calculation is done, the transform is written in the track binding object: // Apply the final position and rotation values in the track binding trackBinding.position = accumPosition + m_InitialPosition * (1.0f - totalPositionWeight); trackBinding.rotation = accumRotation.Blend(m_InitialRotation, 1.0f - totalRotationWeight); 4. Customize a clip's appearance ClipEditor can be used to augment the capabilities of a clip in the editor. It works like a custom Inspector; the CustomTimelineEditor attribute is used to tell Timeline that a ClipEditor class should be associated to a given clip. [CustomTimelineEditor(typeof(TweenClip))] public class TweenClipEditor : ClipEditor { //... } It is possible to customize the appearance of a clip with the DrawBackground method: public override void DrawBackground(TimelineClip clip, ClipBackgroundRegion region) { TweenClip asset = clip.asset as TweenClip; if (asset == null) return; // Drawing code here... } Notes Only the portion between (0,1) of the curve will be used. When a clip ends, the object bound to the track will return to its original position."

A cinematic sequence in the Timeline window. For each cut-scene, cinematic, or game-play sequence, the Timeline window saves the following: Timeline Asset: Stores the tracks, clips, and recorded animations without links to the specific GameObjects being animated. The Timeline Asset is saved to the Project. Timeline instance: Stores links to the specific GameObjects being animated or affected by the Timeline Asset. These links, referred to as bindings, are saved to the Scene. Timeline Asset The Timeline window saves track and clip definitions as a Timeline Asset. If you record key animations while creating your cinematic, cut-scene, or game-play sequence, the Timeline window saves the recorded clips as children of the Timeline Asset. The Timeline Asset saves tracks and clips (red). Timeline saves recorded clips (blue) as children of the Timeline Asset. Timeline instance To animate a GameObject in your Scene with a Timeline Asset, you must create a Timeline instance. A Timeline instance associates a Timeline Asset with the GameObject in the Scene, through a Playable Director component. When you select a GameObject in a Scene that has a Playable Director component, the Timeline instance appears in the Timeline window. The bindings appear in the Timeline window and in the Playable Director component (Inspector window). The Playable Director component shows the Timeline Asset (blue) with its bound GameObjects (red). The Timeline window shows the same bindings (red) in the Track list. The Timeline window provides an automated method of creating a Timeline instance while creating a Timeline Asset. Reusing Timeline Assets Because Timeline Assets and Timeline instances are separate, you can reuse the same Timeline Asset with many Timeline instances. For example, you could create a Timeline Asset named VictoryTL with the animation, music, and particle effects that play when the main game character (Player) wins. To reuse the VictoryTL Timeline Asset to animate another game character (Enemy) in the same Scene, you can create another Timeline instance for the secondary game character. The Player GameObject (red) is attached to the VictoryTL Timeline Asset] The Enemy GameObject (blue) is also attached to the VictoryTL Timeline Asset] Because you are reusing the Timeline Asset, any modification to the Timeline Asset in the Timeline window results in changes to all Timeline instances. For example, in the previous example, if you delete the Audio track while modifying the Player Timeline instance, the Timeline window removes the track from the VictoryTL Timeline Asset. The Timeline window also removes the Audio track from all instances of the VictoryTL Timeline Asset, including the Enemy Timeline instance."

The position of the tangents and the selected interpolation mode for each key determines the shape of the animation curve. binding or Track binding: Refers to the link between Timeline Asset tracks and the GameObjects in the scene. When you link a GameObject to a track, the track animates the GameObject. Bindings are stored as part of the Timeline instance. blend and blend area: The area where two Animation clips, Audio clips, or Control clips overlap. The overlap creates a transition that is referred to as a blend. The duration of the overlap is referred to as the blend area. The blend area sets the duration of the transition. Blend In curve: In a blend between two Animation clips, Audio clips, or Control clips, there are two blend curves. The blend curve for the incoming clip is referred to as the Blend In curve. Blend Out curve: In a blend between two Animation clips, Audio clips, or Control clips, there are two blend curves. The blend curve for the out-going clip is referred to as the Blend Out curve. clip: A generic term that refers to any clip within the Clips view of the Timeline window. Clips view: The area in the Timeline window where you add, position, and manipulate clips. Control/Command: This term is used when instructing the user to press or hold down the Control key on Windows, or the Command key on Mac. Curves view: The area in the Timeline window that shows the animation curves for Infinite clips or for Animation clips that have been converted from Infinite clips. The Curves view is similar to Curves mode in the Animation window. Gap extrapolation: How an Animation track approximates animation data in the gaps before and after an Animation clip. field: A generic term that describes an editable box that the user clicks and types-in a value. A field is also referred to as a property. incoming clip: The second clip in a blend between two clips. The first clip, the out-going clip, transitions to the second clip, the incoming clip. Infinite clip: A special animation clip that contains basic key animation recorded directly to an Animation track within the Timeline window. An Infinite clip cannot be positioned, trimmed, or split because it does not have a defined duration: it spans the entirety of an Animation track. interpolation: The estimation of values that determine the shape of an animation curve between two keys. interpolation mode: The interpolation algorithm that draws the animation curve between two keys. The interpolation mode also joins or breaks left and right tangents. key: The value of an animatable property, set at a specific point in time. Setting at least two keys for the same property creates an animation. out-going clip: The first clip in a blend between two clips. The first clip, the out-going clip, transitions to the second clip, the incoming clip. Playhead Location field: The field that expresses the location of the Timeline Playhead in either frames or seconds, depending on the Timeline Settings. property: A generic term for the editable fields, buttons, checkboxes, or menus that comprise a component. An editable field is also referred to as a field. tangent: One of two handles that controls the shape of the animation curve before and after a key. Tangents appear when a key is selected in the Curves view, or when a key is selected in the Curve Editor. tangent mode: The selected interpolation mode used by the left tangent, right tangent, or both tangents. Timeline or Unity's Timeline: Generic terms that refer to all features, windows, editors, and components related to creating, modifying, or reusing cut-scenes, cinematics, and game-play sequences. Timeline Asset: Refers to the tracks, clips, and recorded animation that comprise a cinematic, cut-scene, game-play sequence, or other effect created with the Timeline window. A Timeline Asset does not include bindings to the GameObjects animated by the Timeline Asset. The bindings to scene GameObjects are stored in the Timeline instance. The Timeline Asset is project-based. Timeline window: The official name of the window where you create, modify, and preview a Timeline instance. Modifications to a Timeline instance also affects the Timeline Asset. Timeline instance: Refers to the link between a Timeline Asset and the GameObjects that the Timeline Asset animates in the scene.

Timeline Play button To preview the Timeline instance in Timeline Playback mode, click the Timeline Play button, or press the Spacebar. Timeline Playback mode does the following: Begins playback at the current location of the Timeline Playhead and continues to the end of the Timeline instance. If the Play Range button is enabled, playback is restricted to a specified time range. The Timeline Playhead position moves along the Timeline instance. The Playhead Location field shows the position of the Timeline Playhead in either frames, timecode or seconds, depending on the Timeline settings. To pause playback, click the Timeline Play button again, or press the Spacebar. When playback reaches the end of the Timeline instance, the Wrap Mode determines whether playback should hold, repeat, or do nothing. The Wrap Mode setting is a Playable Director component property. Timeline Playback mode provides a preview of the Timeline instance while in the Timeline window. Timeline Playback mode is only a simulation of Play Mode in the Game View.

For example, 8 frames and 34 subframes displays as 8.34. When the Timeline window is set to Timecode, the Playhead Location shows seconds, frames, and subframes. For example, 6 seconds, 17 frames, and 59 subframes displays as 6:17 [.59]. When the Timeline window is set to Seconds, the Playhead Location shows seconds. For example, 6.5 seconds displays as 6:50. Manipulating clips, previewing Timeline instances, and positioning the playhead at the subframes level is useful when attempting to synchronize animation and effects with audio. Many high-end audio processing software products create audio waveforms with subframe accuracy. Edge Snap Enable the Edge Snap option to snap clips when you position, trim, and create blends. When enabled, the Timeline window snaps the start or end of a clip when dragged within 10 pixels of the Timeline Playhead, the start or end of a clip on the same track, the start or end of a clip on another track, or the start or end of the entire Timeline instance.

This workflow also demonstrates how to match clip offsets, manually adjust clip offsets, and create blends between clips to minimize jumping and sliding. Although this workflow uses a humanoid, you can use this animation method for any GameObject. This workflow assumes that you have already created a Timeline instance with an empty Animation track bound to a humanoid. For example, the DefaultMale humanoid is bound to an empty Animation track: DefaultMale humanoid bound to an empty Animation track. From your Project, drag a motion clip into the Animation track to create a new Animation clip. For example, drag an idle pose as the first clip to start the humanoid from an idle stance. To position, resize, or trim your Animation clip in the Clips view, select Mix mode as the Clip Edit mode. There are three different Clip Edit modes that change the editing behaviour of the Timeline window. When the Timeline window is in Mix mode, you can drag and trim clips to create blends. Animation track, bound to the DefaultMale humanoid, with an idle pose (Idle) as its Animation clip. The Mix mode (red circle) is the selected Clip Edit mode. Add a second Animation clip. This example adds a run and turn left clip (named Run_Left) to the Animation track, and then resizes the clip to include one loop, so the DefaultMale runs and turns 180 degrees. Animation track with an Idle clip and a Run_Left clip Play the Timeline instance. In this example, the DefaultMale humanoid jumps between each Animation clip because the position of the humanoid at the end of the first Animation clip (Idle) does not match the position of the humanoid at the start of the next Animation clip (RunLeft). The humanoid jumps between the first Animation clip, which ends at frame 29 (red arrow and box), and the second Animation clip, which starts at frame 30 (ghost with green arrow and box) Matching clips To fix the animation jump between clips, match the offset of each Animation clip. The Timeline window provides different methods for matching offsets. In this example, Timeline matches the second Animation clip with the previous clip. To do this, select the Run_Left clip, right-click and select Match Offsets to Previous Clip. Right-click and select Match Offsets to Previous Clip to match the offsets of the selected Animation clip with the preceding Animation clip After matching offsets, the position and rotation of the humanoid at the start of the second Animation clip (frame 30, ghost with green arrow) matches the position and rotation of the humanoid at the end of the first Animation clip (frame 29, red arrow) Play the Timeline instance again. Although the position and rotation of the humanoid matches, there is still a jump between the two Animation clips because the humanoid is in different poses. At the end of the first Animation clip, the humanoid is standing upright with its feet together. At the start of the second Animation clip, the humanoid is bent forward with its feet apart. Blending clips Create a blend to remove the jump and transition between the two poses. Adjust the size of the clips, the Blend Area, the Clip In, and the shape of each Blend Curve to create a transition between the two poses. For example, in the transition between the Idle clip and the Run_Left clip, the Idle clip was resized to 36 frames and the Run_Left clip was repositioned to start at frame 25. The rest of the clip properties are unchanged from their default values. With Mix mode selected, you can create a blend (red circle) between two clips to create a smooth transition between two animations. As the Idle clip transitions to the Run_Left clip, the blend removes the obvious jump between poses. The transition between most body parts appears natural, however in this example, the blend between the different positions of the foot results in an unnatural foot slide. Reducing foot slide To reduce foot sliding, manually adjust the offset of an Animation clip so that the position of the foot changes less drastically. To manually adjust the offset, select the Animation clip in the Timeline window. In the Inspector window, expand Animation Playable Asset. Select an Animation clip. In the Inspector window, expand Animation Playable Asset (red) to view the Clip Transform Offsets.

Under Clip Transform Offsets, enable the Move tool. The Move Gizmo appears in the Scene view, at the root of the Animation clip. Enable the Move tool (Inspector window, red arrow) to show the Move Gizmo (green arrow) in the Scene view Use one of the following methods to manually adjust the offset position of the Animation clip: In the Scene view, drag the Move Gizmo.

Associating a Timeline Asset with a Playable Director component creates a Timeline instance and allows you to specify which objects in the Scene are animated by the Timeline Asset. To animate a GameObject, it must also have an Animator component. The Timeline window automatically creates a Timeline instance while creating a new Timeline Asset. The Timeline window also creates the necessary components. To create a new Timeline Asset and Timeline instance, follow these steps: In your Scene, select the GameObject that you want to use as the focus of your cinematic or other gameplay-based sequence. Open the Timeline window (menu: Window > Sequencing > Timeline). If the GameObject does not yet have a Playable Director component attached to a Timeline Asset, a message in the Timeline window prompts you to click the Create button. Click Create. A dialog box prompts you for the name and location of the Timeline Asset you are creating. You can also specify tags to identify the Timeline Asset. Click Save. The Timeline window does the following: Saves a new Timeline Asset to the Assets directory of your Project. If you did not change the name and location of the Timeline Asset you are creating, the Timeline window creates a name based on the selected GameObject with the \"Timeline\" suffix. For example, selecting the GameObject called \"Enemy\" names the Asset \"EnemyTimeline\". Adds an empty Animation track to the Timeline Asset. Adds a Playable Director component to the selected GameObject, and sets the Playable property to the Timeline Asset. This creates a Timeline instance. Sets the binding on the Animation track in the Playable Director component to the selected GameObject. The Animation track does not have any clips, so the selected GameObject is not animated. Adds an Animator component to the selected GameObject. The Animator component animates the GameObject through the Timeline instance. The GameObject cannot be animated without an Animator component."

Use this technique to animate a humanoid to, for example, run and carry an object. For information on creating an Avatar mask, see Avatar Mask window. This task assumes that you have already created a Timeline instance with a simple Animation clip on an Animation track bound to a humanoid: This example uses a humanoid bound to a simple run cycle animation (RunForward) that loops once Right-click the Animation track and select Add Override Track from the context menu. An Animation Override track, named Override 0, is linked to the selected Animation track. Notice that the Animation Override track is not bound to a GameObject. Because the Override track is linked to the Animation track above, the Override track is bound to the same GameObject, in this case, the DefaultMale humanoid. To add an Override track, right-click the Animation track and select Add Override Track from the context menu] From your Project, drag an Animation Clip with upper-body animation into the Override track. For example, drag an animation of a humanoid standing still and waving their arms. Position and resize the clip to match the Animation clip that you want to override. The Animation Override track contains an Animation clip of a humanoid standing still, waving their arms (WavingArms). This clip was resized to match the Animation clip (RunForward) of the parent Animation track. Play the Timeline instance. In this example, the WavingArms clip completely overrides the RunForward clip. To combine the lower-body animation from one Animation clip with upper-body animation from another Animation clip, specify an Avatar Mask for the Animation Override track. To specify an Avatar Mask, select the Override track to view its properties in the Inspector window From the Project, drag an Avatar Mask, that masks the lower body animation, into the Avatar Mask property in the Inspector window. Enable the Apply Avatar Mask checkbox. An Avatar Mask icon appears beside the track name. An Avatar Mask, that masks the lower body animation, is specified for the Animation Overview clip in the Inspector window. This allows the upper body animation to pass through. The Avatar Mask icon (red) indicates that the Animation Override track uses an Avatar Mask. Play the Timeline instance. In this example, the DefaultMale humanoid uses upper-body animation from the WavingArms clip and lower-body animation from the RunForward clip. To temporarily disable the Avatar Mask, click the Avatar Mask icon. The Avatar Mask icon (red) is gray when disabled. The WavingArms clip completely overrides the RunForward clip."

    "keywords": "Nesting Timeline instances Timeline supports nesting Timeline instances. A nested Timeline instance refers to a Timeline instance that is added within another Timeline instance. The master Timeline instance refers to the main or parent Timeline instance that includes other Timeline instances. Nesting Timeline instances is useful if you have a large team working on different aspects of a Project and you want them to collaborate on the same cinematic or cut-scene. For example, you are developing a puzzle game that starts with a cinematic of the character walking into frame while the pieces on the game board move into position. You could create a master Timeline instance for the character walking into frame. You could create another Timeline instance for the game board animation. You could then nest the game board animation into the master Timeline instance of the character walking into frame. The master NestTL Timeline instance has a character walking and theme music. A Control track nests the BoardTL Timeline instance for the game board animation. By creating a master Timeline instance with nested Timeline instances, different teams can work on different animations and then combine the animations into one master Timeline. In the puzzle game example, one team could work on the character Timeline instance, and another team could work on the game board animation. When you have two Timeline instances, and you want to nest one instance into the other, open the Timeline instance that you want to be the master Timeline instance. To ensure that the Timeline window does not switch while you select GameObjects, click the lock icon (red arrow): The master NestTL Timeline instance has a character walking and theme music. Find the GameObject in your Scene that is associated with the Timeline instance that you want to nest inside the master Timeline instance. Drag the GameObject into the Clips view of the Timeline window. The Board GameObject is associated with the BoardTL Timeline instance. Drag the Board GameObject into the NestTL master Timeline to nest the BoardTL Timeline instance in the NestTL Timeline instance. The Timeline window creates a Control track and places the Control clip where you drop the GameObject. The Control clip is set to the same size as the Timeline instance. When a Control clip contains a nested Timeline instance, a downward arrow appears beside its name. To edit a nested Timeline instance from the master timeline, double-click its Control clip. Double-click the Control clip to edit the nested BoardTL Timeline instance from within the master A warning icon appears beside the name of the nested Timeline instance because the Timeline Playhead is outside the range of the nested Timeline. Timeline also disables the Timeline Playhead controls. When you edit a nested Timeline instance, you cannot change the duration of the nested Timeline instance. You must return to the master Timeline instance and change the duration of the Control clip to change the duration of the nested Timeline instance. To return to the master, click the name of the master Timeline instance (red arrow): Warning icon (red circle) means the Timeline Playhead Controls are disabled. The Timeline window is in this state because, by default, the size of the Control clip in the master Timeline instance determines when the nested Timeline instance is active. Use one of the following methods to change this state and edit the nested Timeline instance: Click the Timeline ruler to move the Timeline Playhead into the nested Timeline. This enables editing and the Timeline Playback Controls. In the master Timeline instance, move the Timeline Playhead to within the Control clip before you double-click the Control clip. In the master Timeline instance, select the Control clip, and disable the Control Activation property in the Inspector window. Disable the Control Activation property (red outline) to have the nested Timeline instance active throughout the duration of the master Timeline instance."

When you record directly to an empty Animation track, you create an Infinite clip. An Infinite clip is a clip that contains basic key animation recorded through the Timeline window. An Infinite clip cannot be positioned, trimmed, or split because it does not have a defined size: it spans the entirety of an Animation track. Before creating an Infinite clip, you must add an empty Animation track for the GameObject that you want to animate. In the Track list, click the red circular Record button for the empty Animation track to enable Record mode. Click the Record button on an empty track to enable Record mode When a track is in Record mode, the clip area of the track is drawn in red with the \"Recording...\" message, and the Record button blinks on and off. Timeline window in Record mode When in Record mode, any modification to an animatable property of the GameObject sets a key at the location of the Timeline Playhead. To start creating an animation, move the Timeline Playhead to the location of the first key, and do one of the following: In the Inspector window, right-click the name of the property and choose Add Key. This adds an animation key for the property without changing its value. A diamond appears in the Infinite clip to show the position of the key. In the Inspector window, change the value of the animatable property of the GameObject. This adds an animation key for the property with its changed value. A diamond appears in the Infinite clip.

Red background indicates that you’ve added an animation curve for the property to the clip Setting a key adds a diamond to the Infinite clip Move the playhead to a different position on the Timeline and change the animatable properties of the GameObject. At each position, the Timeline window adds a diamond to the Infinite clip for any changed properties and adds a key to its associated animation curves. While in Record mode, you can right-click the name of an animatable property name to perform keying operations such as setting a key without changing its value, jumping to the next or previous keys, and removing keys. For example, to set a key for the position of a GameObject without changing its value, right-click Position and select Add Key from the context menu. Right-click the name of an animatable property to perform keying operations When you finish the animation, click the blinking Record button to disable Record mode. An Infinite clip appears as a dope sheet in the Timeline window, but you cannot edit the keys in this view. Use the Curves view to edit keys. You can also double-click the Infinite clip and edit the keys with the Animation window. An Infinite clip appears as a dope sheet Save the Scene or Project to save the Timeline Asset and the Infinite clip. The Timeline window saves the key animation from the Infinite clip as a source asset. The source asset is named \"Recorded\" and saved as a child of the Timeline Asset in the Project. Recorded clips are saved under the Timeline Asset in the Project For every additional recorded Infinite clip, the Timeline window numbers each clip sequentially, starting at \"(1)\". For example, a Timeline Asset with three recorded Infinite clips are named \"Recorded\", \"Recorded (1)\", and \"Recorded (2)\". If you delete a Timeline Asset, its recorded clips are also removed."

The Event System consists of a few components that work together to send events. When you add an Event System component to a GameObject you will notice that it does not have much functionality exposed, this is because the Event System itself is designed as a manager and facilitator of communication between Event System modules. The primary roles of the Event System are as follows: Manage which GameObject is considered selected Manage which Input Module is in use Manage Raycasting (if required) Updating all Input Modules as required Input Modules An Input Module is where the main logic of how you want the Event System to behave lives, they are used for: Handling Input Managing event state Sending events to scene objects. Only one Input Module can be active in the Event System at a time, and they must be components on the same GameObject as the Event System component. If you want to write a custom Input Module, send events supported by existing UI components in Unity. To extend and write your own events, see the Messaging System documentation. Raycasters Raycasters are used for figuring out what the pointer is over. It is common for Input Modules to use the Raycasters configured in the Scene to calculate what the pointing device is over. There are 3 provided Raycasters that exist by default: Graphic Raycaster - Used for UI elements Physics 2D Raycaster - Used for 2D physics elements Physics Raycaster - Used for 3D physics elements If you have a 2d / 3d Raycaster configured in your Scene, it is easy to make non-UI elements receive messages from the Input Module. Simply attach a script that implements one of the event interfaces. For examples of this, see the IPointerEnterHandler and IPointerClickHandler Scripting Reference pages."

    "title": "Creating UI elements from scripting | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Creating UI elements from scripting If you are creating a dynamic UI where UI elements appear, disappear, or change based on user actions or other actions in the game, you may need to make a script that instantiates new UI elements based on custom logic. Creating a prefab of the UI element In order to be able to easily instantiate UI elements dynamically, the first step is to create a prefab for the type of UI element that you want to be able to instantiate. Set up the UI element the way you want it to look in the Scene, and then drag the element into the Project View to make it into a prefab. For example, a prefab for a button could be a Game Object with a Image component and a Button component, and a child Game Object with a Text component. Your setup might be different depending on your needs. You might wonder why we don't have a API methods to create the various types of controls, including visuals and everything. The reason is that there are an infinite number of way e.g. a button could be setup. Does it use an image, text, or both? Maybe even multiple images? What is the text font, color, font size, and alignment? What sprite or sprites should the image use? By letting you make a prefab and instantiate that, you can set it up exactly the way you want. And if you later want to change the look and feel of your UI you can just change the prefab and then it will be reflected in your UI, including the dynamically created UI. Instantiating the UI element Prefabs of UI elements are instantiated as normal using the Instantiate method. When setting the parent of the instantiated UI element, it's recommended to do it using the Transform.SetParent method with the worldPositionStays parameter set to false. Positioning the UI element A UI Element is normally positioned using its Rect Transform. If the UI Element is a child of a Layout Group it will be automatically positioned and the positioning step can be skipped. When positioning a Rect Transform it's useful to first determine it has or should have any stretching behavior or not. Stretching behavior happens when the anchorMin and anchorMax properties are not identical. For a non-stretching Rect Transform, the position is set most easily by setting the anchoredPosition and the sizeDelta properties. The anchoredPosition specifies the position of the pivot relative to the anchors. The sizeDelta is just the same as the size when there's no stretching. For a stretching Rect Transform, it can be simpler to set the position using the offsetMin and offsetMax properties. The offsetMin property specifies the corner of the lower left corner of the rect relative to the lower left anchor. The offsetMax property specifies the corner of the upper right corner of the rect relative to the upper right anchor. Customizing the UI Element If you are instantiating multiple UI elements dynamically, it's unlikely that you'll want them all to look the same and do the same. Whether it's buttons in a menu, items in an inventory, or something else, you'll likely want the individual items to have different text or images and to do different things when interacted with. This is done by getting the various components and changing their properties. See the scripting reference for the Image and Text components, and for how to work with UnityEvents from scripting."

    "title": "Making UI elements fit the size of their content | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Making UI elements fit the size of their content Normally when positioning a UI element with its Rect Transform, its position and size is specified manually (optionally including behavior to stretch with the parent Rect Transform). However, sometimes you may want the rectangle to be automatically sized to fit the content of the UI element. This can be done by adding a component called Content Size Fitter. Fit to size of Text In order to make a Rect Transform with a Text component on it fit the text content, add a Content Size Fitter component to the same Game Object which has the Text component. Then set both the Horizontal Fit and Vertical Fit dropdowns to the Preferred setting. How does it work? What happens here is that the Text component functions as a Layout Element that can provide information about how big its minimum and preferred size is. In a manual layout this information is not used. A Content Size Fitter is a type of Layout Controller, which listens to layout information provided by Layout Elements and control the size of the Rect Transform according to this. Remember the pivot When UI elements are automatically resized to fit their content, you should pay extra attention to the pivot of the Rect Transform. The pivot will stay in place when the element is resized, so by setting the pivot position you can control in which direction the element will expand or shrink. For example, if the pivot is in the center, then the element will expand equally in all directions, and if the pivot is in the upper left corner, then the element will expand to the right and down. Fit to size of UI element with child Text If you have a UI element, such as a Button, that has a background image and a child Game Object with a Text component on it, you probably want the whole UI element to fit the size of the text - maybe with some padding. In order to do this, first add a Horizontal Layout Group to the UI element, then add a Content Size Fitter too. Set the Horizontal Fit, the Vertical Fit, or both to the Preferred setting. You can add and tweak padding using the padding property in the Horizontal Layout Group. Why use a Horizontal Layout Group? Well, it could have been a Vertical Layout Group as well - as long as there is only a single child, they produce the same result. How does it work? The Horizontal (or Vertical) Layout Group functions both as a Layout Controller and as a Layout Element. First it listens to the layout information provided by the children in the group - in this case the child Text. Then it determines how large the group must be (at minimum, and preferably) in order to be able to contain all the children, and it functions as a Layout Element that provides this information about its minimum and preferred size. The Content Size Fitter listens to layout information provided by any Layout Element on the same Game Object - in this case provided by the Horizontal (or Vertical) Layout Group. Depending on its settings, it then controls the size of the Rect Transform based on this information. Once the size of the Rect Transform has been set, the Horizontal (or Vertical) Layout Group makes sure to position and size its children according to the available space. See the page about the Horizontal Layout Group for more information about how it controls the positions and sizes of its children. Make children of a Layout Group fit their respective sizes If you have a Layout Group (horizontal or vertical) and want each of the UI elements in the group to fit their respective content, what do you do? You can't put a Content Size Fitter on each child. The reason is that the Content Size Fitter wants control over its own Rect Transform, but the parent Layout Group also wants control over the child Rect Transform. This creates a conflict and the result is undefined behavior. However, it isn't necessary either. The parent Layout Group can already make each child fit the size of the content. What you need to do is to disable the Child Force Expand toggles on the Layout Group. If the children are themselves Layout Groups too, you may need to disable the Child Force Expand toggles on those too. Once the children no longer expand with flexible width, their alignment can be specified in the Layout Group using the Child Alignment setting. What if you want some of the children to expand to fill additional available space, but not the other children? You can easily control this by adding a Layout Element component to the children you want to expand and enabling the Flexible Width or Flexible Height properties on those Layout Elements. The parent Layout Group should still have the Child Force Expand toggles disabled, otherwise all the children will expand flexibly. How does it work? A Game Object can have multiple components that each provide layout information about minimum, preferred and flexible sizes. A priority system determines which values take effect over others. The Layout Element component has a higher priority than the Text, Image, and Layout Group components, so it can be used to override any layout information values they provide. When the Layout Group listens to the layout information provided by the children, it will take the overridden flexible sizes into account. Then, when controlling the sizes of the children, it will not make them any bigger than their preferred sizes. However, if the Layout Group has the Child Force Expand option enabled, it will always make the flexible sizes of all the children be at least 1. More information This page has explained solutions to a few common use cases. For a more in depth explanation of the auto layout system, see the UI Auto Layout page."

    "title": "Designing UI for Multiple Resolutions | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Designing UI for Multiple Resolutions Modern games and applications often need to support a wide variety of different screen resolutions and particularly UI layouts need to be able to adapt to that. The UI System in Unity includes a variety of tools for this purpose that can be combined in various ways. In this how-to we're going to use a simple case study and look at and compare the different tools in the context of that. In our case study we have three buttons in the corners of the screen as shown below, and the goal is to adapt this layout to various resolutions. For this how-to we're going to consider four screen resolutions: Phone HD in portrait (640 x 960) and landscape (960 x 640) and Phone SD in portrait (320 x 480) and landscape (480 x 320). The layout is initially setup in the Phone HD Portrait resolution. Using anchors to adapt to different aspect ratios UI elements are by default anchored to the center of the parent rectangle. This means that they keep a constant offset from the center. If the resolution is changed to a landscape aspect ratio with this setup, the buttons may not even be inside the rectangle of the screen anymore. One way to keep the buttons inside the screen is to change the layout such that the locations of the buttons are tied to their respective corners of the screen. The anchors of the top left button can be set to the upper left corner using the Anchors Preset drop down in the Inspector, or by dragging the triangular anchor handles in the Scene View. It's best to do this while the current screen resolution set in the Game View is the one the layout is initially designed for, where the button placement looks correct. (See the UI Basic Layout page for more information on anchors.) Similarly, the anchors for the lower left and lower right buttons can be set to the lower left corner and lower right corner, respectively. Once the buttons have been anchored to their respective corners, they stick to them when changing the resolution to a different aspect ratio. When the screen size is changed to a larger or smaller resolution, the buttons will also remain anchored to their respective corners. However, since they keep their original size as specified in pixels, they may take up a larger or smaller proportion of the screen. This may or may not be desirable, depending on how you would like your layout to behave on screens of different resolutions. In this how-to, we know that the smaller resolutions of Phone SD Portrait and Landscape don't correspond to screens that are physically smaller, but rather just screens with a lower pixel density. On these lower-density screens the buttons shouldn't appear larger than on the high-density screens - they should instead appear with the same size. This means that the buttons should become smaller by the same percentage as the screen is smaller. In other words, the scale of the buttons should follow the screen size. This is where the Canvas Scaler component can help. Scaling with Screen Size The Canvas Scaler component can be added to a root Canvas - a Game Object with a Canvas component on it, which all the UI elements are children of. It is also added by default when creating a new Canvas through the GameObject menu. In the Canvas Scaler component, you can set its UI Scale Mode to Scale With Screen Size. With this scale mode you can specify a resolution to use as reference. If the current screen resolution is smaller or larger than this reference resolution, the scale factor of the Canvas is set accordingly, so all the UI elements are scaled up or down together with the screen resolution. In our case, we set the Canvas Scaler to be the Phone HD portrait resolution of 640 x 960. Now, when setting the screen resolution to the Phone SD portrait resolution of 320 x 480, the entire layout is scaled down so it appears proportionally the same as in full resolution. Everything is scaled down: The button sizes, their distances to the edges of the screen, the button graphics, and the text elements. This means that the layout will appear the same in the Phone SD portrait resolution as in Phone HD portrait; only with a lower pixel density. One thing to be aware of: After adding a Canvas Scaler component, it's important to also check how the layout looks at other aspect ratios. By setting the resolution back to Phone HD landscape, we can see that the buttons now appear bigger than they should (and used to). The reason for the larger buttons in landscape aspect ratio comes down to how the Canvas Scaler setting works. By default it compares the width or the current resolution with the width of the Canvas Scaler and the result is used as the scale factor to scale everything with. Since the current landscape resolution of 960 x 640 has a 1.5 times larger width than the portrait Canvas Scaler of 640 x 960, the layout is scaled up by 1.5. The component has a property called Match which can be 0 (Width), 1 (Height) or a value in between. By default it's set to 0, which compares the current screen width with the Canvas Scaler width as described. If the Match property is set to 0.5 instead, it will compare both the current width to the reference width and the current height to the reference height, and choose a scale factor that's in between the two. Since in this case the landscape resolution is 1.5 times wider but also 1.5 times shorter, those two factor even out and produce a final scale factor of 1, which means the buttons keep their original size. At this point the layout supports all the four screen resolutions using a combination of appropriate anchoring and the Canvas Scaler component on the Canvas. See the Canvas Scaler reference page for more information on different ways to scale UI elements in relation to different screen sizes."

    "keywords": "Creating Screen Transitions The need to transition between multiple UI screens is fairly common. In this page we will explore a simple way to create and manage those transitions using animation and State Machines to drive and control each screen. Overview The high-level idea is that each of our screens will have an Animator Controller with two states (Open and Closed) and a boolean Parameter (Open). To transition between screens you will only need to close the currently open Screen and open the desired one. To make this process easier we will create a small Class ScreenManager that will keep track and take care of closing any already open Screen for us. The button that triggers the transition will only have to ask the ScreenManager to open the desired screen. Thinking about Navigation If you plan to support controller/keyboard navigation of UI elements, then it's important to have a few things in mind. It's important to avoid having Selectable elements outside the screen since that would enable players to select offscreen elements, we can do that by deactivating any off-screen hierarchy. We also need to make sure when a new screen is shown we set a element from it as selected, otherwise the player would not be able to navigate to the new screen. We will take care of all that in the ScreenManager class below. Setting up the Animator Controller Let's take a look at the most common and minimal setup for the Animation Controller to do a Screen transition. The controller will need a boolean parameter (Open) and two states (Open and Closed), each state should have an animation with only one keyframe, this way we let the State Machine do the transition blending for us. Now we need to create the transition between both states, let's start with the transition from Open to Closed and let's set the condition properly, we want to go from Open to Closed when the parameter Open is set to false. Now we create the transition from Closed to Open and set the condition to go from Closed to Open when the parameter Open is true. Managing the screens With all the above set up, the only thing missing is for us to set the parameter Open to true on the screens Animator we want to transition to and Open to false on the currently open screens Animator. To do that, we will create a small script: using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.UI; using UnityEngine.EventSystems; using System.Collections; using System.Collections.Generic; public class ScreenManager : MonoBehaviour { //Screen to open automatically at the start of the Scene public Animator initiallyOpen; //Currently Open Screen private Animator m_Open; //Hash of the parameter we use to control the transitions. private int m_OpenParameterId; //The GameObject Selected before we opened the current Screen. //Used when closing a Screen, so we can go back to the button that opened it. private GameObject m_PreviouslySelected; //Animator State and Transition names we need to check against. const string k_OpenTransitionName = \"Open\"; const string k_ClosedStateName = \"Closed\"; public void OnEnable() { //We cache the Hash to the \"Open\" Parameter, so we can feed to Animator.SetBool. m_OpenParameterId = Animator.StringToHash (k_OpenTransitionName); //If set, open the initial Screen now. if (initiallyOpen == null) return; OpenPanel(initiallyOpen); } //Closes the currently open panel and opens the provided one. //It also takes care of handling the navigation, setting the new Selected element. public void OpenPanel (Animator anim) { if (m_Open == anim) return; //Activate the new Screen hierarchy so we can animate it. anim.gameObject.SetActive(true); //Save the currently selected button that was used to open this Screen. (CloseCurrent will modify it) var newPreviouslySelected = EventSystem.current.currentSelectedGameObject; //Move the Screen to front. anim.transform.SetAsLastSibling(); CloseCurrent(); m_PreviouslySelected = newPreviouslySelected; //Set the new Screen as then open one. m_Open = anim; //Start the open animation m_Open.SetBool(m_OpenParameterId, true); //Set an element in the new screen as the new Selected one. GameObject go = FindFirstEnabledSelectable(anim.gameObject); SetSelected(go); } //Finds the first Selectable element in the providade hierarchy. static GameObject FindFirstEnabledSelectable (GameObject gameObject) { GameObject go = null; var selectables = gameObject.GetComponentsInChildren<Selectable> (true); foreach (var selectable in selectables) { if (selectable.IsActive () && selectable.IsInteractable ()) { go = selectable.gameObject; break; } } return go; } //Closes the currently open Screen //It also takes care of navigation. //Reverting selection to the Selectable used before opening the current screen. public void CloseCurrent() { if (m_Open == null) return; //Start the close animation. m_Open.SetBool(m_OpenParameterId, false); //Reverting selection to the Selectable used before opening the current screen. SetSelected(m_PreviouslySelected); //Start Coroutine to disable the hierarchy when closing animation finishes. StartCoroutine(DisablePanelDeleyed(m_Open)); //No screen open. m_Open = null; } //Coroutine that will detect when the Closing animation is finished and it will deactivate the //hierarchy. IEnumerator DisablePanelDeleyed(Animator anim) { bool closedStateReached = false; bool wantToClose = true; while (!closedStateReached && wantToClose) { if (!anim.IsInTransition(0)) closedStateReached = anim.GetCurrentAnimatorStateInfo(0).IsName(k_ClosedStateName); wantToClose = !anim.GetBool(m_OpenParameterId); yield return new WaitForEndOfFrame(); } if (wantToClose) anim.gameObject.SetActive(false); } //Make the provided GameObject selected //When using the mouse/touch we actually want to set it as the previously selected and //set nothing as selected for now. private void SetSelected(GameObject go) { //Select the GameObject. EventSystem.current.SetSelectedGameObject(go); //If we are using the keyboard right now, that's all we need to do. var standaloneInputModule = EventSystem.current.currentInputModule as StandaloneInputModule; if (standaloneInputModule != null) return; //Since we are using a pointer device, we don't want anything selected. //But if the user switches to the keyboard, we want to start the navigation from the provided game object. //So here we set the current Selected to null, so the provided gameObject becomes the Last Selected in the EventSystem. EventSystem.current.SetSelectedGameObject(null); } } Let's hook up this script, we do this by creating a new GameObject, we can rename it \"ScreenManager\" for instance, and add the component above to it. You can assign an initial screen to it, this screen will be open at the start of your scene. Now for the final part, let's make the UI buttons work. Select the button that should trigger the screen transition and add a new action under the On Click () list in the Inspector. Drag the ScreenManager GameObject we just created to the ObjectField, on the dropdown select ScreenManager->OpenPanel (Animator) and drag and drop the panel you want to open when the user clicks the button to the las ObjectField. Notes This technique only requires each screen to have an AnimatorController with an Open parameter and a Closed state to work - it doesn't matter how your screen or State Machine are constructed. This technique also works well with nested screens, meaning you only need one ScreenManager for each nested level. The State Machine we set up above has the default state of Closed, so all of the screens that use this controller start as closed. The ScreenManager provides an initiallyOpen property so you can specify which screen is shown first."

    "keywords": "Creating a World Space UI The UI system makes it easy to create UI that is positioned in the world among other 2D or 3D objects in the Scene. Start by creating a UI element (such as an Image) if you don't already have one in your scene by using GameObject > UI > Image. This will also create a Canvas for you. Set the Canvas to World Space Select your Canvas and change the Render Mode to World Space. Now your Canvas is already positioned in the World and can be seen by all cameras if they are pointed at it, but it is probably huge compared to other objects in your Scene. We'll get back to that. Decide on a resolution First you need to decide what the resolution of the Canvas should be. If it was an image, what should the pixel resolution of the image be? Something like 800x600 might be a good starting point. You enter the resolution in the Width and Height values of the Rect Transform of the Canvas. It's probably a good idea to set the position to 0,0 at the same time. Specify the size of the Canvas in the world Now you should consider how big the Canvas should be in the world. You can use the Scale tool to simply scale it down until it has a size that looks good, or you can decide how big it should be in meters. If you want it to have a specific width in meters, you can can calculate the needed scale by using meter_size / canvas_width. For example, if you want it to be 2 meters wide and the Canvas width is 800, you would have 2 / 800 = 0.0025. You then set the Scale property of the Rect Transform on the Canvas to 0.0025 for both X, Y, and Z in order to ensure that it's uniformly scaled. Another way to think of it is that you are controlling the size of one pixel in the Canvas. If the Canvas is scaled by 0.0025, then that is also the size in the world of each pixel in the Canvas. Position the Canvas Unlike a Canvas set to Screen Space, a World Space Canvas can be freely positioned and rotated in the Scene. You can put a Canvas on any wall, floor, ceiling, or slanted surface (or hanging freely in the air of course). Just use the normal Translate and Rotate tools in the toolbar. Create the UI Now you can begin setting up your UI elements and layouts the same way you would with a Screen Space Canvas."

The system works using custom interfaces that can be implemented on a MonoBehaviour to indicate that the component is capable of receiving a callback from the messaging system. When the call is made a target GameObject is specified; the call will be issued on all components of the GameObject that implement the specified interface that the call is to be issued against. The messaging system allows for custom user data to be passed, as well as how far through the GameObject hierarchy the event should propagate; that is should it just execute for the specified GameObject, or should it also execute on children and parents. In addition to this the messaging framework provides helper functions to search for and find GameObjects that implement a given messaging interface. The messaging system is generic and designed for use not just by the UI system but also by general game code. It is relatively trivial to add custom messaging events and they will work using the same framework that the UI system uses for all event handling. Defining A Custom Message If you wish to define a custom message it is relatively simple. In the UnityEngine.EventSystems namespace there is a base interface called 'IEventSystemHandler'. Anything that extends from this can be considered as a target for receiving events via the messaging system. public interface ICustomMessageTarget : IEventSystemHandler { // functions that can be called via the messaging system void Message1(); void Message2(); } Once this interface is defined then it can be implemented by a MonoBehaviour. When implemented it defines the functions that will be executed if the given message is issued against this MonoBehaviours GameObject. public class CustomMessageTarget : MonoBehaviour, ICustomMessageTarget { public void Message1() { Debug.Log (\"Message 1 received\"); } public void Message2() { Debug.Log (\"Message 2 received\"); } } Now that a script exists that can receive the message we need to issue the message. Normally this would be in response to some loosely coupled event that occurs. For example, in the UI system we issue events for such things as PointerEnter and PointerExit, as well as a variety of other things that can happen in response to user input into the application. To send a message a static helper class exists to do this. As arguments it requires a target object for the message, some user specific data, and a functor that maps to the specific function in the message interface you wish to target. ExecuteEvents.Execute<ICustomMessageTarget>(target, null, (x,y)=>x.Message1()); This code will execute the function Message1 on any components on the GameObject target that implement the ICustomMessageTarget interface. The scripting documentation for the ExecuteEvents class covers other forms of the Execute functions, such as Executing in children or in parents."

    "keywords": "Rich Text The text for UI elements and text meshes can incorporate multiple font styles and sizes. Rich text is supported both for the UI System and the legacy GUI system. The Text, GUIStyle, GUIText and TextMesh classes have a Rich Text setting which instructs Unity to look for markup tags within the text. The Debug.Log function can also use these markup tags to enhance error reports from code. The tags are not displayed but indicate style changes to be applied to the text. Markup format The markup system is inspired by HTML but isn't intended to be strictly compatible with standard HTML. The basic idea is that a section of text can be enclosed inside a pair of matching tags:- We are <b>not</b> amused. As the example shows, the tags are just pieces of text inside the \"angle bracket\" characters, < and >. You place the opening tag at the beginning of the section. The text inside the tag denotes its name (which in this case is just b). You place another tag at the end of the section. This is the closing tag. It has the same name as the opening tag, but the name is prefixed with a slash / character. Every opening tag must have a corresponding closing tag. If you don't close an opening tag, it is rendered as regular text. The tags are not displayed to the user directly but are interpreted as instructions for styling the text they enclose. The b tag used in the example above applies boldface to the word \"not\", so the text appears ons creen as:- We are not amused A marked up section of text (including the tags that enclose it) is referred to as an element. Nested elements It is possible to apply more than one style to a section of text by \"nesting\" one element inside another We are <b><i>definitely not</i></b> amused The <i> tag applies italic style, so this would be presented onscreen as We are definitely not amused Note the ordering of the closing tags, which is in reverse to that of the opening tags. The reason for this is perhaps clearer when you consider that the inner tags need not span the whole text of the outermost element We are <b>absolutely <i>definitely</i> not</b> amused which gives We are absolutely definitely not amused Tag parameters Some tags have a simple all-or-nothing effect on the text but others might allow for variations. For example, the color tag needs to know which color to apply. Information like this is added to tags by the use of parameters:- We are <color=green>green</color> with envy Which produces this result: Note that the ending tag doesn't include the parameter value. Optionally, the value can be surrounded by quotation marks but this isn't required. Tag parameters cannot include blank spaces. For example: We are <color = green>green</color> with envy does not work because of the spaces to either side of the = character. Supported tags The following list describes all the styling tags supported by Unity. Tag Description Example Notes b Renders the text in boldface. We are <b>not</b> amused. i Renders the text in italics. We are <i>usually</i> not amused. size Sets the size of the text according to the parameter value, given in pixels. We are <size=50>largely</size> unaffected. Although this tag is available for Debug.Log, you will find that the line spacing in the window bar and Console looks strange if the size is set too large. color Sets the color of the text according to the parameter value. The color can be specified in the traditional HTML format. #rrggbbaa ...where the letters correspond to pairs of hexadecimal digits denoting the red, green, blue and alpha (transparency) values for the color. For example, cyan at full opacity would be specified by color=#00ffffff... You can specify hexadecimal values in uppercase or lowercase; #FF0000 is equivalent to #ff0000. We are <color=#ff0000ff>colorfully</color> amused Another option is to use the name of the color. This is easier to understand but naturally, the range of colors is limited and full opacity is always assumed. <color=cyan>some text</color> The available color names are given in the table below. material This is only useful for text meshes and renders a section of text with a material specified by the parameter. The value is an index into the text mesh's array of materials as shown by the inspector. We are <material=2>texturally</material> amused quad This is only useful for text meshes and renders an image inline with the text. It takes parameters that specify the material to use for the image, the image height in pixels, and a further four that denote a rectangular area of the image to display. Unlike the other tags, quad does not surround a piece of text and so there is no ending tag - the slash character is placed at the end of the initial tag to indicate that it is \"self-closing\". <quad material=1 size=20 x=0.1 y=0.1 width=0.5 height=0.5> This selects the material at position in the renderer's material array and sets the height of the image to 20 pixels. The rectangular area of image starts at given by the x, y, width and height values, which are all given as a fraction of the unscaled width and height of the texture. Supported colors The following table lists colors for which you can use a name instead of a hexadecimal tag in the <color> rich text tag. Color name Hex value Swatch aqua (same as cyan) #00ffffff black #000000ff blue #0000ffff brown #a52a2aff cyan (same as aqua) #00ffffff darkblue #0000a0ff fuchsia (same as magenta) #ff00ffff green #008000ff grey #808080ff lightblue #add8e6ff lime #00ff00ff magenta (same as fuchsia) #ff00ffff maroon #800000ff navy #000080ff olive #808000ff orange #ffa500ff purple #800080ff red #ff0000ff silver #c0c0c0ff teal #008080ff white #ffffffff yellow #ffff00ff Editor GUI Rich text is disabled by default in the editor GUI system but it can be enabled explicitly using a custom GUIStyle.

This is the most powerful of the transition modes due to the number of properties that can be animated simultaneously. To use the Animation transition mode, an Animator Component needs to be attached to the controller element. This can be done automatically by clicking \"Auto Generate Animation\". This also generates an Animator Controller with states already set up, which will need to be saved. The new Animator controller is ready to use straight away. Unlike most Animator Controllers, this controller also stores the animations for the controller's transitions and these can be customised, if desired. For example, if a Button element with an Animator controller attached is selected, the animations for each of the button's states can be edited by opening the Animation window (Window>Animation). There is an Animation Clip pop-up menu to select the desired clip. Choose from \"Normal\", \"Highlighted\", \"Pressed\" and \"Disabled\". The Normal State is set by the values on button element itself and can be left empty. On all other states, the most common configuration is a single keyframe at the start of the timeline. The transition animation between states will be handled by the Animator. As an example, the width of the button in the Highlighted State could be changed by selecting the Highlighted state from the Animation Clip pop up menu and with the playhead at the start of the time line: Select the record Button Change the width of the Button in the inspector Exit the record mode. Change to play mode to see how the button grows when highlighted. Any number of properties can have their parameters set in this one keyframe. Several buttons can share the same behaviour by sharing Animator Controllers. The UI Animation transition mode is not compatible with Unity's legacy animation system.

    "title": "Auto Layout | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Auto Layout The Rect Transform layout system is flexible enough to handle a lot of different types of layouts and it also allows placing elements in a complete freeform fashion. However, sometimes something a bit more structured can be needed. The auto layout system provides ways to place elements in nested layout groups such as horizontal groups, vertical groups, or grids. It also allows elements to automatically be sized according to the contained content. For example a button can be dynamically resized to exactly fit its text content plus some padding. The auto layout system is a system built on top of the basic Rect Transform layout system. It can optionally be used on some or all elements. Understanding Layout Elements The auto layout system is based on a concept of layout elements and layout controllers. A layout element is an Game Object with a Rect Transform and optionally other components as well. The layout element has certain knowledge about which size it should have. Layout elements don't directly set their own size, but other components that function as layout controllers can use the information they provide in order to calculate a size to use for them. A layout element has properties that defines its own: Minimum width Minimum height Preferred width Preferred height Flexible width Flexible height Examples of layout controller components that use the information provided by layout elements are Content Size Fitter and the various Layout Group components. The basic principles for how layout elements in a layout group are sized is as follows: First minimum sizes are allocated. If there is sufficient available space, preferred sizes are allocated. If there is additional available space, flexible size is allocated. Any Game Object with a Rect Transform on it can function as a layout element. They will by default have minimum, preferred, and flexible sizes of 0. Certain components will change these layout properties when added to the Game Object. The Image and Text components are two examples of components that provide layout element properties. They change the preferred width and height to match the sprite or text content. Layout Element Component If you want to override the minimum, preferred, or flexible size, you can do that by adding a Layout Element component to the Game Object. The Layout Element component lets you override the values for one or more of the layout properties. Enable the checkbox for a property you want to override and then specify the value you want to override with. See the reference page for Layout Element for more information. Understanding Layout Controllers Layout controllers are components that control the sizes and possibly positions of one or more layout elements, meaning Game Objects with Rect Transforms on. A layout controller may control its own layout element (the same Game Object it is on itself) or it may control child layout elements. A component that functions as a layout controller may also itself function as a layout element at the same time. Content Size Fitter The Content Size Fitter functions as a layout controller that controls the size of its own layout element. The simplest way to see the auto layout system in action is to add a Content Size Fitter component to a Game Object with a Text component. If you set either the Horizontal Fit or Vertical Fit to Preferred, the Rect Transform will adjust its width and/or height to fit the Text content. See the reference page for Content Size Fitter for more information. Aspect Ratio Fitter The Aspect Ratio Fitter functions as a layout controller that controls the size of its own layout element. It can adjust the height to fit the width or vice versa, or it can make the element fit inside its parent or envelope its parent. The Aspect Ratio Fitter does not take layout information into account such as minimum size and preferred size. See the reference page for Aspect Ratio Fitter for more information. Layout Groups A layout group functions as a layout controller that controls the sizes and positions of its child layout elements. For example, a Horizontal Layout Group places its children next to each other, and a Grid Layout Group places its children in a grid. A layout group doesn't control its own size. Instead it functions as a layout element itself which may be controlled by other layout controllers or be set manually. Whatever size a layout group is allocated, it will in most cases try to allocate an appropriate amount of space for each of its child layout elements based on the minimum, preferred, and flexible sizes they reported. Layout groups can also be nested arbitrarily this way. See the reference pages for Horizontal Layout Group, Vertical Layout Group and Grid Layout Group for more information. Driven Rect Transform properties Since a layout controller in the auto layout system can automatically control the sizes and placement of certain UI elements, those sizes and positions should not be manually edited at the same time through the Inspector or Scene View. Such changed values would just get reset by the layout controller on the next layout calculation anyway. The Rect Transform has a concept of driven properties to address this. For example, a Content Size Fitter which has the Horizontal Fit property set to Minimum or Preferred will drive the width of the Rect Transform on the same Game Object. The width will appear as read-only and a small info box at the top of the Rect Transform will inform that one or more properties are driven by Conten Size Fitter. The driven Rect Transforms properties have other reasons beside preventing manual editing. A layout can be changed just by changing the resolution or size of the Game View. This in turn can change the size or placement of layout elements, which changes the values of driven properties. But it wouldn't be desirable that the Scene is marked as having unsaved changes just because the Game View was resized. To prevent this, the values of driven properties are not saved as part of the Scene and changes to them do not mark the scene as changed. Technical Details The auto layout system comes with certain components built-in, but it is also possible to create new components that controls layouts in custom ways. This is done by having a component implement specific interfaces which are recognized by the auto layout system. Layout Interfaces A component is treated as a layout element by the auto layout system if it implements the interface ILayoutElement. A component is expected to drive the Rect Transforms of its children if it implements the interface ILayoutGroup. A component is expected to drive its own RectTransform if it implements the interface ILayoutSelfController. Layout Calculations The auto layout system evaluates and executes layouts in the following order: The minimum, preferred, and flexible widths of layout elements are calculated by calling CalculateLayoutInputHorizontal on ILayoutElement components. This is performed in bottom-up order, where children are calculated before their parents, such that the parents may take the information in their children into account in their own calculations. The effective widths of layout elements are calculated and set by calling SetLayoutHorizontal on ILayoutController components. This is performed in top-down order, where children are calculated after their parents, since allocation of child widths needs to be based on the full width available in the parent. After this step the Rect Transforms of the layout elements have their new widths. The minimum, preferred, and flexible heights of layout elements are calculated by calling CalculateLayoutInputVertical on ILayoutElement components. This is performed in bottom-up order, where children are calculated before their parents, such that the parents may take the information in their children into account in their own calculations. The effective heights of layout elements are calculated and set by calling SetLayoutVertical on ILayoutController components. This is performed in top-down order, where children are calculated after their parents, since allocation of child heights needs to be based on the full height available in the parent. After this step the Rect Transforms of the layout elements have their new heights. As can be seen from the above, the auto layout system evaluates widths first and then evaluates heights afterwards. Thus, calculated heights may depend on widths, but calculated widths can never depend on heights. Triggering Layout Rebuild When a property on a component changes which can cause the current layout to no longer be valid, a layout recalculation is needed. This can be triggered using the call: LayoutRebuilder.MarkLayoutForRebuild (transform as RectTransform); The rebuild will not happen immediately, but at the end of the current frame, just before rendering happens. The reason it is not immediate is that this would cause layouts to be potentially rebuild many times during the same frame, which would be bad for performance. Guidelines for when a rebuild should be triggered: In setters for properties that can change the layout. In these callbacks: OnEnable OnDisable OnRectTransformDimensionsChange OnValidate (only needed in the editor, not at runtime) OnDidApplyAnimationProperties"

If you want to test yourself while reading, you can create an Image using the menu GameObject -> UI -> Image. The Rect Tool Every UI element is represented as a rectangle for layout purposes. This rectangle can be manipulated in the Scene View using the Rect Tool in the toolbar. The Rect Tool is used both for Unity's 2D features and for UI, and in fact can be used even for 3D objects as well. The Rect Tool can be used to move, resize and rotate UI elements. Once you have selected a UI element, you can move it by clicking anywhere inside the rectangle and dragging. You can resize it by clicking on the edges or corners and dragging. The element can be rotated by hovering the cursor slightly away from the corners until the mouse cursor looks like a rotation symbol. You can then click and drag in either direction to rotate. Just like the other tools, the Rect Tool uses the current pivot mode and space, set in the toolbar. When working with UI it's usually a good idea to keep those set to Pivot and Local. Rect Transform The Rect Transform is a new transform component that is used for all UI elements instead of the regular Transform component. Rect Transforms have position, rotation, and scale just like regular Transforms, but it also has a width and height, used to specify the dimensions of the rectangle. Resizing Versus Scaling When the Rect Tool is used to change the size of an object, normally for Sprites in the 2D system and for 3D objects it will change the local scale of the object. However, when it's used on an object with a Rect Transform on it, it will instead change the width and the height, keeping the local scale unchanged. This resizing will not affect font sizes, border on sliced images, and so on. Pivot Rotations, size, and scale modifications occur around the pivot so the position of the pivot affects the outcome of a rotation, resizing, or scaling. When the toolbar Pivot button is set to Pivot mode, the pivot of a Rect Transform can be moved in the Scene View. Anchors Rect Transforms include a layout concept called anchors. Anchors are shown as four small triangular handles in the Scene View and anchor information is also shown in the Inspector. If the parent of a Rect Transform is also a Rect Transform, the child Rect Transform can be anchored to the parent Rect Transform in various ways. For example, the child can be anchored to the center of the parent, or to one of the corners. The anchoring also allows the child to stretch together with the width or height of the parent. Each corner of the rectangle has a fixed offset to its corresponding anchor, i.e. the top left corner of the rectangle has a fixed offset to the top left anchor, etc. This way the different corners of the rectangle can be anchored to different points in the parent rectangle. The positions of the anchors are defined in fractions (or percentages) of the parent rectangle width and height. 0.0 (0%) corresponds to the left or bottom side, 0.5 (50%) to the middle, and 1.0 (100%) to the right or top side. But anchors are not limited to the sides and middle; they can be anchored to any point within the parent rectangle. You can drag each of the anchors individually, or if they are together, you can drag them together by clicking in the middle in between them and dragging. If you hold down Shift key while dragging an anchor, the corresponding corner of the rectangle will move together with the anchor. A useful feature of the anchor handles is that they automatically snap to the anchors of sibling rectangles to allow for precise positioning. Anchor presets In the Inspector, the Anchor Preset button can be found in the upper left corner of the Rect Transform component. Clicking the button brings up the Anchor Presets dropdown. From here you can quickly select from some of the most common anchoring options. You can anchor the UI element to the sides or middle of the parent, or stretch together with the parent size. The horizontal and vertical anchoring is independent. The Anchor Presets buttons displays the currently selected preset option if there is one. If the anchors on either the horizontal or vertical axis are set to different positions than any of the presets, the custom options is shown. Anchor and position fields in the Inspector You can click the Anchors expansion arrow to reveal the anchor number fields if they are not already visible. Anchor Min corresponds to the lower left anchor handle in the Scene View, and Anchor Max corresponds to the upper right handle. The position fields of rectangle are shown differently depending on whether the anchors are together (which produces a fixed width and height) or separated (which causes the rectangle to stretch together with the parent rectangle). When all the anchor handles are together the fields displayed are Pos X, Pos Y, Width and Height. The Pos X and Pos Y values indicate the position of the pivot relative to the anchors. When the anchors are separated the fields can change partially or completely to Left, Right, Top and Bottom. These fields define the padding inside the rectangle defined by the anchors. The Left and Right fields are used if the anchors are separated horizontally and the Top and Bottom fields are used if they are separated vertically. Note that changing the values in the anchor or pivot fields will normally counter-adjust the positioning values in order to make the rectangle stay in place. In cases where this is not desired, enable Raw edit mode by clicking the R button in the Inspector. This causes the anchor and pivot value to be able to be changed without any other values changing as a result. This will likely cause the rectangle to be visually moved or resized, since its position and size is dependent on the anchor and pivot values."

    "title": "Canvas | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Canvas The Canvas is the area that all UI elements should be inside. The Canvas is a Game Object with a Canvas component on it, and all UI elements must be children of such a Canvas. Creating a new UI element, such as an Image using the menu GameObject > UI > Image, automatically creates a Canvas, if there isn't already a Canvas in the scene. The UI element is created as a child to this Canvas. The Canvas area is shown as a rectangle in the Scene View. This makes it easy to position UI elements without needing to have the Game View visible at all times. Canvas uses the EventSystem object to help the Messaging System. Draw order of elements UI elements in the Canvas are drawn in the same order they appear in the Hierarchy. The first child is drawn first, the second child next, and so on. If two UI elements overlap, the later one will appear on top of the earlier one. To change which element appear on top of other elements, simply reorder the elements in the Hierarchy by dragging them. The order can also be controlled from scripting by using these methods on the Transform component: SetAsFirstSibling, SetAsLastSibling, and SetSiblingIndex. Render Modes The Canvas has a Render Mode setting which can be used to make it render in screen space or world space. Screen Space - Overlay This render mode places UI elements on the screen rendered on top of the scene. If the screen is resized or changes resolution, the Canvas will automatically change size to match this. Screen Space - Camera This is similar to Screen Space - Overlay, but in this render mode the Canvas is placed a given distance in front of a specified Camera. The UI elements are rendered by this camera, which means that the Camera settings affect the appearance of the UI. If the Camera is set to Perspective, the UI elements will be rendered with perspective, and the amount of perspective distortion can be controlled by the Camera Field of View. If the screen is resized, changes resolution, or the camera frustum changes, the Canvas will automatically change size to match as well. World Space In this render mode, the Canvas will behave as any other object in the scene. The size of the Canvas can be set manually using its Rect Transform, and UI elements will render in front of or behind other objects in the scene based on 3D placement. This is useful for UIs that are meant to be a part of the world. This is also known as a \"diegetic interface\"."

    "title": "Interaction Components | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Interaction Components This section covers components in the UI system that handles interaction, such as mouse or touch events and interaction using a keyboard or controller. The interaction components are not visible on their own, and must be combined with one or more visual components in order to work correctly. Common Functionality Most of the interaction components have some things in common. They are selectables, which means they have shared built-in functionality for visualising transitions between states (normal, highlighted, pressed, disabled), and for navigation to other selectables using keyboard or controller. This shared functionality is described on the Selectable page. The interaction components have at least one UnityEvent that is invoked when user interacts with the component in specific way. The UI system catches and logs any exceptions that propagate out of code attached to UnityEvent. Button A Button has an OnClick UnityEvent to define what it will do when clicked. See the Button page for details on using the Button component. Toggle A Toggle has an Is On checkbox that determines whether the Toggle is currently on or off. This value is flipped when the user clicks the Toggle, and a visual checkmark can be turned on or off accordingly. It also has an OnValueChanged UnityEvent to define what it will do when the value is changed. See the Toggle page for details on using the Toggle component. Toggle Group A Toggle Group can be used to group a set of Toggles that are mutually exclusive. Toggles that belong to the same group are constrained so that only one of them can be selected at a time - selecting one of them automatically deselects all the others. See the Toggle Group page for details on using the Toggle Group component. Slider A Slider has a decimal number Value that the user can drag between a minimum and maximum value. It can be either horizontal or vertical. It also has a OnValueChanged UnityEvent to define what it will do when the value is changed. See the Slider page for details on using the Slider component. Scrollbar A Scrollbar has a decimal number Value between 0 and 1. When the user drags the scrollbar, the value changes accordingly. Scrollbars are often used together with a Scroll Rect and a Mask to create a scroll view. The Scrollbar has a Size value between 0 and 1 that determines how big the handle is as a fraction of the entire scrollbar length. This is often controlled from another component to indicate how big a proportion of the content in a scroll view is visible. The Scroll Rect component can automatically do this. The Scrollbar can be either horizontal or vertical. It also has a OnValueChanged UnityEvent to define what it will do when the value is changed. See the Scrollbar page for details on using the Scrollbar component. Dropdown A Dropdown has a list of options to choose from. A text string and optionally an image can be specified for each option, and can be set either in the Inspector or dynamically from code. It has a OnValueChanged UnityEvent to define what it will do when the currently chosen option is changed. See the Dropdown page for details on using the Dropdown component. Input Field An Input Field is used to make the text of a Text Element editable by the user. It has a UnityEvent to define what it will do when the text content is changed, and an another to define what it will do when the user has finished editing it. See the Input Field page for details on using the Input Field component. Scroll Rect (Scroll View) A Scroll Rect can be used when content that takes up a lot of space needs to be displayed in a small area. The Scroll Rect provides functionality to scroll over this content. Usually a Scroll Rect is combined with a Mask in order to create a scroll view, where only the scrollable content inside the Scroll Rect is visible. It can also additionally be combined with one or two Scrollbars that can be dragged to scroll horizontally or vertically. See the Scroll Rect page for details on using the Scroll Rect component."

    "keywords": "Visual Components With the introduction of the UI system, new Components have been added that will help you create GUI specific functionality. This section will cover the basics of the new Components that can be created. Text The Text component, which is also known as a Label, has a Text area for entering the text that will be displayed. It is possible to set the font, font style, font size and whether or not the text has rich text capability. There are options to set the alignment of the text, settings for horizontal and vertical overflow which control what happens if the text is larger than the width or height of the rectangle, and a Best Fit option that makes the text resize to fit the available space. Image An Image has a Rect Transform component and an Image component. A sprite can be applied to the Image component under the Target Graphic field, and its colour can be set in the Color field. A material can also be applied to the Image component. The Image Type field defines how the applied sprite will appear, the options are: Simple - Scales the whole sprite equally. Sliced - Utilises the 3x3 sprite division so that resizing does not distort corners and only the center part is stretched. Tiled - Similar to Sliced, but tiles (repeats) the center part rather than stretching it. For sprites with no borders at all, the entire sprite is tiled. Filled - Shows the sprite in the same way as Simple does except that it fills in the sprite from an origin in a defined direction, method and amount. The option to Set Native Size, which is shown when Simple or Filled is selected, resets the image to the original sprite size. Images can be imported as UI sprites by selecting Sprite( 2D / UI) from the 'Texture Type' settings. Sprites have extra import settings compared to the old GUI sprites, the biggest difference is the addition of the sprite editor. The sprite editor provides the option of 9-slicing the image, this splits the image into 9 areas so that if the sprite is resized the corners are not stretched or distorted. Raw Image The Image component takes a sprite but Raw Image takes a texture (no borders etc). Raw Image should only be used if necessary otherwise Image will be suitable in the majority of cases. Mask A Mask is not a visible UI control but rather a way to modify the appearance of a control’s child elements. The mask restricts (ie, “masks”) the child elements to the shape of the parent. So, if the child is larger than the parent then only the part of the child that fits within the parent will be visible. Effects Visual components can also have various simple effects applied, such as a simple drop shadow or outline. See the UI Effects reference page for more information."

    "keywords": "Canvas The Canvas component represents the abstract space in which the UI is laid out and rendered. All UI elements must be children of a GameObject that has a Canvas component attached. When you create a UI element object from the menu (GameObject > Create UI), a Canvas object will be created automatically if there isn't one in the scene already. Properties Property: Function: Render Mode The way the UI is rendered to the screen or as an object in 3D space (see below). The options are Screen Space - Overlay, Screen Space - Camera and World Space. Pixel Perfect (Screen Space modes only) Should the UI be rendered without antialiasing for precision? Render Camera (Screen Space - Camera mode only) The camera to which the UI should be rendered (see below). Plane Distance (Screen Space - Camera mode only) The distance at which the UI plane should be placed in front of the camera. Event Camera (World Space mode only) The camera that will be used to process UI events. Receives Events Are UI events processed by this Canvas? Details A single Canvas for all UI elements is sufficient but multiple Canvases in the scene is possible. It is also possible use nested Canvases, where one Canvas is placed as a child of another for optimization purposes. A nested Canvas uses the same Render Mode as its parent. Traditionally, UIs are rendered as if they were simple graphic designs drawn directly on the screen. That is to say, they have no concept of a 3D space being viewed by a camera. Unity supports this kind of screen space rendering but also allows UIs to rendered as objects in the scene, depending on the value of the Render Mode property. The modes available are Screen Space - Overlay, Screen Space - Camera and World Space. Screen Space - Overlay In this mode, the Canvas is scaled to fit the screen and then rendered directly without reference to the scene or a camera (the UI will be rendered even if there is no camera in the scene at all). If the screen's size or resolution are changed then the UI will automatically rescale to fit. The UI will be drawn over any other graphics such as the camera view. Note: The Screen Space - Overlay canvas needs to be stored at the top level of the hierarchy. If this is not used then the UI may disappear from the view. This is a built-in limitation. Keep the Screen Space - Overlay canvas at the top level of the hierarchy to get expected results. Screen Space - Camera In this mode, the Canvas is rendered as if it were drawn on a plane object some distance in front of a given camera. The onscreen size of the UI does not vary with the distance since it is always rescaled to fit exactly within the camera frustum. If the screen's size or resolution or the camera frustum are changed then the UI will automatically rescale to fit. Any 3D objects in the scene that are closer to the camera than the UI plane will be rendered in front of the UI, while objects behind the plane will be obscured. World Space This mode renders the UI as if it were a plane object in the scene. Unlike Screen Space - Camera mode, however, the plane need not face the camera and can be oriented however you like. The size of the Canvas can be set using its Rect Transform but its onscreen size will depend on the viewing angle and distance of the camera. Other scene objects can pass behind, through or in front of the Canvas. Hints Read more about setting up a World Space Canvas on the Creating a World Space UI page. For information about making your Canvas and UI scale to different resolutions or aspect ratios, see the Designing UI for Multiple Resolutions page as well as the Canvas Scaler page."

Details Note that some RectTransform calculations are performed at the end of a frame, just before calculating UI vertices, in order to ensure that they are up to date with all the latest changes performed throughout the frame. This means that they haven't yet been calculated for the first time in the Start callback and first Update callback. You can work around this by creating a Start() callback and adding Canvas.ForceUpdateCanvases() method to it. This will force Canvas to be updated not at the end of the frame, but when that method is called. See the Basic Layout page for a full introduction and overview of how to use the Rect Transform."

Settings for Constant Physical Size: Property: Function: Physical Unit The physical unit to specify positions and sizes in. Fallback Screen DPI The DPI to assume if the screen DPI is not known. Default Sprite DPI The pixels per inch to use for sprites that have a 'Pixels Per Unit' setting that matches the 'Reference Pixels Per Unit' setting. Reference Pixels Per Unit If a sprite has this 'Pixels Per Unit' setting, then its DPI will match the 'Default Sprite DPI' setting. Settings for World Space Canvas (shown when Canvas component is set to World Space): Property: Function: Dynamic Pixels Per Unit The amount of pixels per unit to use for dynamically created bitmaps in the UI, such as Text. Reference Pixels Per Unit If a sprite has this 'Pixels Per Unit' setting, then one pixel in the sprite will cover one unit in the world. If the 'Reference Pixels Per Unit' is set to 1, then the 'Pixels Per Unit' setting in the sprite will be used as-is. Details For a Canvas set to 'Screen Space - Overlay' or 'Screen Space - Camera', the Canvas Scaler UI Scale Mode can be set to Constant Pixel Size, Scale With Screen Size, or Constant Physical Size. Constant Pixel Size Using the Constant Pixel Size mode, positions and sizes of UI elements are specified in pixels on the screen. This is also the default functionality of the Canvas when no Canvas Scaler is attached. However, With the Scale Factor setting in the Canvas Scaler, a constant scaling can be applied to all UI elements in the Canvas. Scale With Screen Size Using the Scale With Screen Size mode, positions and sizes can be specified according to the pixels of a specified reference resolution. If the current screen resolution is larger than the reference resolution, the Canvas will keep having only the resolution of the reference resolution, but will scale up in order to fit the screen. If the current screen resolution is smaller than the reference resolution, the Canvas will similarly be scaled down to fit. If the current screen resolution has a different aspect ratio than the reference resolution, scaling each axis individually to fit the screen would result in non-uniform scaling, which is generally undesirable. Instead of this, the ReferenceResolution component will make the Canvas resolution deviate from the reference resolution in order to respect the aspect ratio of the screen. It is possible to control how this deviation should behave using the Screen Match Mode setting. Constant Physical Size Using the Constant Physical Size mode, positions and sizes of UI elements are specified in physical units, such as millimeters, points, or picas. This mode relies on the device reporting its screen DPI correctly. You can specify a fallback DPI to use for devices that do not report a DPI. World Space For a Canvas set to 'World Space' the Canvas Scaler can be used to control the pixel density of UI elements in the Canvas. Hints See the page Designing UI for Multiple Resolutions for a step by step explanation of how Rect Transform anchoring and Canvas Scaler can be used in conjunction to make UI layouts that adapt to different resolutions and aspect ratios."

The size is determined by the minimum or preferred sizes provided by layout element components on the Game Object. Such layout elements can be Image or Text components, layout groups, or a Layout Element component. It's worth keeping in mind that when a Rect Transform is resized - whether by a Content Size Fitter or something else - the resizing is around the pivot. This means that the direction of the resizing can be controlled using the pivot. For example, when the pivot is in the center, the Content Size Fitter will expand the Rect Transform out equally in all directions. And when the pivot is in the upper left corner, the Content Size Fitter will expand the Rect Transform down and to the right."

Events Property: Function: On Value Changed A UnityEvent that is invoked when a user has clicked one of the options in the dropdown list. Details The list of options is specified in the Inspector or can be assigned from code. For each option a text string can be specified, and optionally an image as well, if the Dropdown is setup to support it. The button has a single event called On Value Changed that responds when the user completes a click on one of the options in the list. It supports sending an integer number value that is the index of the selected option. 0 is the first option, 1 is the second, and so on. The template system The Dropdown control is designed to have a child GameObject which serves as a template for the dropdown list that is shown when clicking the dropdown control. The template GameObject is inactive by default, but can be made active while editing the template to better see what's going on. A reference to the template object must be specified in the Template property of the Dropdown component. The template must have a single item in it with a Toggle component on. When the actual dropdown list is created upon clicking the dropdown control, this item is duplicated multiple times, with one copy used for each option in the list. The parent of the item is automatically resized so it can fit all the items inside. The template can be setup in many different ways. The setup used by the GameObject > UI > Dropdown menu item includes a scroll view, such that if there are too many options to show at once, a scrollbar will appear and the user can scroll through the options. This is however not a mandatory part of the template setup. (See the ScrollRect page for more information about setup of Scroll Views.) Setup of text and image support The dropdown supports one text content and one image content for each option. Both text and image is optional. They can only be used if the Dropdown is setup to support it. The dropdown supports text for each option when the Caption Text and Item Text properties are both setup. These are setup by default when using the GameObject > UI > Dropdown menu item. The Caption Text is the Text component to hold the text for the currently selected option. It is typically a child to the Dropdown GameObject. The Item Text is the Text component to hold the text for each option. It is typically a child to the Item GameObject. The dropdown supports an image for each option when the Caption Image and Item Image properties are both setup. These are not setup by default. The Caption Image is the Image component to hold the image for the currently selected option. It is typically a child to the Dropdown GameObject. The Item Image is the Image component to hold the image for each option. It is typically a child to the Item GameObject. The actual text and images used for the dropdowns are specified in the Options property of the Dropdown component, or can be set from code. Placement of the dropdown list The placement of the dropdown list in relation to the dropdown control is determined by the anchoring and pivot of the Rect Transform of the Template. By default, the list will appear below the control. This is achieved by anchoring the template to the bottom of the control. The pivot of the template also needs to be at the top, so that as the template is expanded to accommodate a variable number of option items, it only expands downwards. The Dropdown control has simple logic to prevent that the dropdown is displayed outside the bounds of the Canvas, since this would make it impossible to select certain options. If the dropdown at its default position is not fully within the Canvas rectangle, its position in relation to the control is reversed. For example, a list that is shown below the control by default will be shown above it instead. This logic is quite simple and has certain limitations. The dropdown template needs to be no larger than half the Canvas size minus the size of the dropdown control, otherwise there may not be room for the list at either position if the dropdown control is placed in the middle of the Canvas."

Description Unlike other layout groups, the Grid Layout Group ignores the minimum, preferred, and flexible size properties of its contained layout elements and instead assigns a fixed size to all of them which is defined with the Cell Size property of the Grid Layout Group itself. Grid Layout Group and auto layout There are special considerations to be aware of when using the Grid Layout Group as part of an auto layout setup, such as using it with a Content Size Fitter. The auto layout system calculates the horizontal and vertical sizes independently. This can be at odds with the Grid Layout Group, where the number of rows depends on the number of columns and vice versa. For any given number of cells, there are different combinations of row count and column count that can make the grid fit its content. In order to aid the layout system, you can specify that you intent the table to have a fixed number of columns or rows by using the Constraint property. Here are suggested ways of using the Layout System with a Content Size Fitter: Flexible width and fixed height To setup a grid with a flexible width and fixed height, where the grid expands horizontally as more elements are added, you can set these properties as follows: Grid Layout Group Constraint: Fixed Row Count Content Size Fitter Horizontal Fit: Preferred Size Content Size Fitter Vertical Fit: Preferred Size or Unconstrained If unconstrained Vertical Fit is used, it's up to you to give the grid a height that is big enough to fit the specified row count of cells. Fixed width and flexible height To setup a grid with a fixed width and flexible height, where the grid expands vertically as more elements are added, you can set these properties as follows: Grid Layout Group Constraint: Fixed Column Count Content Size Fitter Horizontal Fit: Preferred Size or Unconstrained Content Size Fitter Vertical Fit: Preferred Size If unconstrained Horizontal Fit is used, it's up to you to give the grid a width that is big enough to fit the specified column count of cells. Both flexible width and height If you want a grid with both a flexible width and height you can do that, but you will have no control over the specific number of rows and columns. The grid will attempt to make the row and column count approximately the same. You can set these properties as follows: Grid Layout Group Constraint: Flexible Content Size Fitter Horizontal Fit: Preferred Size Content Size Fitter Vertical Fit: Preferred Size"

The result is the mimimum width of the Horizontal Layout Group. The preferred widths of all the child layout elements are added together and the spacing between them is added as well. The result is the preferred width of the Horizontal Layout Group. If the Horizontal Layout Group is at its minimum width or smaller, all the child layout elements will also have their minimum width.

    "keywords": "Layout Element If you want to override the minimum, preferred, or flexible size of a layout element, you can do that by adding a Layout Element component to the GameObject. A layout controller allocates width or height to a layout element in the following order: First, the layout controller allocates the minimum size properties (Min Width, Min Height). If there is sufficient available space, the layout controller allocates the preferred size properties (Preferred Width, Preferred Height). If there is additional available space, the layout controller allocates the flexible size properties (Flexible Width, Flexible Height). For more information about minimum, preferred, and flexible size, see documentation on Auto Layout. Properties When you enable a width or height property, a value field appears next to it. Use this value field to enter the exact value for the width or height. Min and Preferred sizes are in regular units, while the Flexible sizes are in relative units. Property: Function: Ignore Layout When enabled, the layout system ignores this layout element. Min Width The minimum width this layout element should have. Min Height The minimum height this layout element should have. Preferred Width The preferred width this layout element should have before additional available width is allocated. Preferred Height The preferred height this layout element should have before additional available height is allocated. Flexible Width The relative amount of additional available width this layout element should fill out relative to its siblings. Flexible Height The relative amount of additional available height this layout element should fill out relative to its siblings. Layout Priority The layout priority for this component. If a GameObject has more than one component with layout properties (for example, an Image component and a LayoutElement component), the layout system uses the property values from the component with the highest Layout Priority. If the components have the same Layout Priority, the layout system uses the highest value for each property, regardless of which component it comes from. Description The Layout Element component lets you override the values for one or more of the layout properties. Enable the checkbox for a property you want to override and then specify the value you want to override with. Minimum and preferred sizes are defined in regular units, while the flexible sizes are defined in relative units. If any layout element has flexible size greater than zero, it means that all the available space will be filled out. The relative flexible size values of the siblings determines how big a proportion of the available space each sibling fills out. Most commonly, flexible width and height is set to just 0 or 1. Specifying both a preferred size and a flexible size can make sense in certain cases. Flexible sizes are only allocated after all preferred sizes have been fully allocated. Thus, a layout element which has a flexible size specified but no preferred size will keep its minimum size until other layout elements have grown to their full preferred size, and only then begin to grow based on additional available space. By also specifying a flexible size, this can be avoided and the element can grow to its preferred size in tandem with the other layout elements that have preferred sizes, and then grow further once all flexible sizes have been allocated."

Properties Property: Function: Show Graphic Should the graphic of the masking (parent) object be drawn with alpha over the child object? Description A common use of a Mask is to show a small section of a large Image, using say a Panel object (menu: GameObject > Create UI > Panel) as a \"frame\". You can achieve this by firstly making the Image a child of the Panel object. You should position the Image so that the area that should be visible is directly behind the Panel area.

Unlike the standard Mask control it has some limitations, but it also has a number of performance benefits. Description A common use of a RectMask2D is to show small sections of a larger area. Using the RectMask2D to frame this area. The limitations of RectMask2D control are: It only works in 2D space It will not properly mask elements that are not coplanar The advantages of RectMask2D are: It does not use the stencil buffer No extra draw calls No material changes Fast performance"

    "title": "Scroll Rect | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Scroll Rect A Scroll Rect can be used when content that takes up a lot of space needs to be displayed in a small area. The Scroll Rect provides functionality to scroll over this content. Usually a Scroll Rect is combined with a Mask in order to create a scroll view, where only the scrollable content inside the Scroll Rect is visible. It can also additionally be combined with one or two Scrollbars that can be dragged to scroll horizontally or vertically. Properties Property: Function: Content This is a reference to the Rect Transform of the UI element to be scrolled, for example a large image. Horizontal Enables horizontal scrolling Vertical Enables vertical scrolling Movement Type Unrestricted, Elastic or Clamped. Use Elastic or Clamped to force the content to remain within the bounds of the Scroll Rect. Elastic mode bounces the content when it reaches the edge of the Scroll Rect Elasticity This is the amount of bounce used in the elasticity mode. Inertia When Inertia is set the content will continue to move when the pointer is released after a drag. When Inertia is not set the content will only move when dragged. Deceleration Rate When Inertia is set the deceleration rate determines how quickly the contents stop moving. A rate of 0 will stop the movement immediately. A value of 1 means the movement will never slow down. Scroll Sensitivity The sensitivity to scroll wheel and track pad scroll events. Viewport Reference to the viewport Rect Transform that is the parent of the content Rect Transform. Horizontal Scrollbar Optional reference to a horizontal scrollbar element. Visibility Whether the scrollbar should automatically be hidden when it isn't needed, and optionally expand the viewport as well. Spacing The space between the scrollbar and the viewport. Vertical Scrollbar Optional reference to a vertical scrollbar element. Visibility Whether the scrollbar should automatically be hidden when it isn't needed, and optionally expand the viewport as well. Spacing The space between the scrollbar and the viewport. Events Property: Function: On Value Changed A UnityEvent that is invoked when the scroll position of the Scroll Rect changes. The event can send the current scroll position as a Vector2 type dynamic argument. Details The important elements in a scroll view are the viewport, the scrolling content, and optionally one or two scrollbars. The root GameObject has the Scroll Rect component. The viewport has a Mask component. The viewport can either be the root GameObject, or a separate GameObject that's a child to the root. If auto-hiding scrollbars are used, it must be a child. The viewport Rect Transform needs to be referenced in the Viewport property of the Scroll Rect. All the scrolling content must be children of a single content GameObject that is a child to the viewport. The content Rect Transform needs to be referenced in the Content property of the Scroll Rect. The scrollbars - if used - are children to the root GameObject. See the Scrollbar page for more details on the setup of a scrollbar and see the section Scrollbar setup below for information about setup of scrollbars with a scroll view. This image shows a setup where the viewport is a child to the scroll view root. This is the default used when using the GameObject > UI > Scroll View menu option. To scroll content, the input must be received from inside the bounds of the ScrollRect, not on the content itself. Take care when using Unrestricted scrolling movement as it is possible to lose control of the content in an irretrievable way. When using Elastic or Constrained movement it is best to position the content so that it starts within the bounds of the ScrollRect, or undesirable behaviour may occur as the RectTransform tries to bring the content back within its bounds. Scrollbar setup Optionally, the Scroll Rect can be linked to a horizontal and/or a vertical Scrollbar. These are typically placed in the hierarchy as siblings to the viewport, and when present, should be dragged into the Horizontal Scrollbar and Vertical Scrollbar properties of the Scroll Rect, respectively. Note that the Direction property on such a horizontal Scrollbar should be set to Left To Right, and on the vertical Scrollbar to Bottom To Top. The scrollbars can optionally have auto-hiding behaviour that hides the scrollbars if the content doesn't need to scroll because it isn't larger than the viewport. Note that the auto-hiding only ever happens in Play Mode. In Edit Mode the scrollbars are always shown. This prevents marking the scene as dirty when it shouldn't be, and also help authoring content with proportions that there's room for even when the scrollbars are shown. If one or both scrollbars have their visibility behaviour set to Auto Hide And Expand View, the viewport is automatically expanded when the scrollbars are hidden in order to take up the extra room where the scrollbars would otherwise have been. With this setup, the position and size of the view is driven by the Scroll Rect, and the width of the horizontal scrollbar as well as the height of the vertical scrollbar is driven as well. With this setup the viewport as well as the scrollbars must be children to the Scroll Rect root GameObject. Hints The pivot and anchors of the content RectTransform can be used to determine how the content is aligned inside the scroll view if the content grows or shrinks. If the content should stay aligned with the top, set the anchors to the top of the parent, and set the pivot to the top position. See the page Making UI elements fit the size of their content for information about how to make the content Rect Transform automatically resize to fit the content."

Properties Property: Function: Interactable Will this component accept input? See Interactable. Transition Properties that determine the way the control responds visually to user actions. See Transition Options. Navigation Properties that determine the sequence of controls. See Navigation Options. Fill Rect The graphic used for the background area of the control. Handle Rect The graphic used for the sliding \"handle\" part of the control Direction The direction in which the Scrollbar's value will increase when the handle is dragged. The options are Left To Right, Right To Left, Bottom To Top and Top To Bottom. Value Initial position value of the Scrollbar, in the range 0.0 to 1.0. Size Fractional size of the handle within the Scrollbar, in the range 0.0 to 1.0. Number Of Steps The number of distinct scroll positions allowed by the Scrollbar. Events Property: Function: On Value Changed A UnityEvent that is invoked when the current value of the Scrollbar changes. The event can send the value as a float type dynamic argument. Details The value of a Scrollbar is determined by the position of the handle along its length with the value being reported as a fraction between the extreme ends. For example, the default left-to-right bar has a value of 0.0 at the left end, 1.0 at the right end and 0.5 indicates the halfway point. A scrollbar can be oriented vertically by choosing Top To Bottom or Bottom To Top for the Direction property. A significant difference between the Scrollbar and the similar Slider control is that the Scrollbar's handle can change in size to represent the distance of scrolling available; when the view can scroll only a short way, the handle will fill up most of the bar and only allow a slight shift either direction. The Scrollbar has a single event called On Value Changed that responds as the user drags the handle. The current value is passed to the even function as a float parameter. Typical use cases for a scrollbar include: Scrolling a piece of text vertically. Scrolling a timeline horizontally. Used as a pair, scrolling a large image both horizontally and vertically to view a zoomed section. The size of the handle changes to indicate the degree of zooming and therefore the available distance for scrolling."

That means - for each individual UI control - you can see which UI control will get focus next, if the user presses an arrow key when the given control has focus. So in the example shown above, If the \"button\" has focus and the user presses the right arrow key, the first (left-hand) vertical slider will then become focused. Note that the vertical sliders can't be focused-away-from using up or down keys, because they control the value of the slider.

    "keywords": "About Visual Scripting Use Visual Scripting to create logic for games or applications without hand-coded C# scripts. Visual Scripting uses visual, node-based graphs, which both programmers and non-programmers use to design final logic or create prototypes. Visual Scripting also has an API that programmers can use for more advanced tasks, or to create custom nodes for other team members. Visual Scripting nodes can represent functions, operators, and variables. Connect these nodes from their ports with edges to design your logic visually. Installation From Unity Editor version 2021.1 onward, Visual Scripting is installed by default as a package. For more information on packages, see the Packages section in the Unity User Manual. For earlier versions of Unity, including 2019 LTS and 2020 LTS, you must install the Visual Scripting package from the Unity Asset Store. Configure Visual Scripting Note To use Visual Scripting in a project for the first time, you must initialize it from the Editor's Project Settings window. To get started with Visual Scripting, configure your project settings and configure your preferences. Choose a control scheme Learn the common keyboard shortcuts and choose a control scheme that suits your needs. Update Visual Scripting Learn how to update Visual Scripting and create and restore backups. System requirements Visual Scripting has no external dependencies."

    "keywords": "Use Visual Scripting with Unity Cloud Build At build time, Unity removes any code that isn't used by a project to reduce build size. This can cause problems with Visual Scripting because Unity can remove code that's necessary for Script Graphs to run in a project. For versions 1.7.x, Visual Scripting generates an AotStubs.cs file, which stores the Unity APIs that graphs use. With the AotStubs.cs file, Unity doesn't remove any Unity APIs used in a graph from a build. You can generate this file when you create a build of a project. Builds through Unity Cloud Build can fail because Cloud Build prevents domain reload between the prebuild and build phases of the project. Without a domain reload, the build doesn't include the generated AotStubs.cs file. For more information about domain reload, see Domain Reloading in the Unity User Manual. To build a Visual Scripting project with Cloud Build, do the following: Build the project locally for your desired platform. For more information on how to build a project, see the relevant section for each platform in Platform development in the User Manual. After the build, do one of the following: Open the project files in the system file explorer. Open the Project window in the Unity Editor. In the project files, go to Assets > Unity.VisualScripting.Generated > VisualScripting.Core. Locate the AotStubs.cs file. Add the AotStubs.cs file to your source control system. Your Cloud Build settings might automatically trigger a new build of the project after you commit the AotStubs.cs file.

    "title": "Control nodes | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Control nodes Note For versions 2019/2020 LTS, download the Visual Scripting package from the Unity Asset Store. Control nodes branch, loop and merge the flow. Branching Branching nodes split the control flow based on a value. If The common if node uses a boolean condition. Consider them as an \"if the condition is true, do something, otherwise, do something else.\" Switch Branch on the value of an enum, a string, or an integer. These nodes are called Switch nodes. To switch on an enum, decide on the type of the enum. The branch output ports appears. To switch on a string or number, create each branch option in the graph inspector. The node is updated with each output port. For strings, optionally choose to ignore the case of the selector. Note A Default port is always added. It is the path that the control flow should take if the input selector does not correspond to any other option. Select Select nodes are the opposite of switch nodes. You can select a single value from a set of options based on a selector. For example, a Select On Integer node that chooses a color based on a player number. Note In the above example predictive debugging warns of a crash if playerNo is not within 1, 2, 3, or 4, because the Default port is not connected. Looping Loops repeats logic for a certain number of iterations before moving on. The logic to be repeated is called the body of the loop. After the loop is over, the exit port is called. Note The body of every loop is called synchronously, not over the course of multiple frames. Co-routine-like behaviours are achieved by listening to the update event manually. While Loop The while loop is the simplest form of loop. It repeats its body while its condition remains true. Only when the condition becomes false does the loop terminate. For example, the following graph generates a new random name until the result isn't contained in the names application variable. Warning Do not create an infinite loop. If the condition is always true, the editor hangs. As loop bodies are synchronous, not parallel, there are few uses for while loops in visual scripting. For Each Loop For Each iterates over every element of a collection. It outputs the current index and item that is being looped over. For example, the following graph outputs four messages to the console: I love my cat I love my dog I love my bird I love my fish To access the key and value from dictionaries in the loop, check the Dictionary box. For Loop For is a numeric loop and requires three integers: a start index, an end index, and a step. The loop starts at the first index, then increments towards the last index via increments of the step. It outputs the current index. For example, this graph counts to ten by skipping odd numbers because of its step. In other words, its output is 0, 2, 4, 6, then 8. The For loop can also be very useful when combined with the Get List Item and Count Items nodes. For example, the following graph is very similar to the last graph as the output to the console is \"I like {animal}s\". Instead of using the For Each node that outputs each item, the graph outputs each item manually by its index in the list. This graph outputs the following messages: I like cats I like dogs I like birds I like horses Break Loop A loop can finish early by using the Break Loop node. As soon as this node is entered, the exit port of the loop is called, no matter how many more iterations remain. For example, even though this for loop is supposed to count to 10, it stops at 5 because of the break. Its output is 0, 1, 2, 3, then 4. Exception Handling Try Catch The Try Catch node handles Exceptions that occur. It prevents your game from crashing in case you suspect some code might fail. Anything that gets executed in the Try branch is considered \"safe\": the script continues from the Catch branch instead if it fails. The Exception port captures information about the failure when that happens. A common way of handling this is to log a warning with the exception message. Note By default, this node catches all exceptions. Be specific in your handling by changing the exception type in the dropdown. The Finally branch is optional. It is always called after Try or Catch, regardless of whether the operation succeeded or not. It is usually used to dispose or destroy any resources that must be freed. This port can be disconnected if there is no need to destroy any resources. Throw The Throw node allows you to raise your own exceptions that stop the flow. These are caught with Try Catch. It is good practice to \"fail early\" by throwing as soon as something unexpected happens. It helps catch bugs early in the chain, instead of letting them trickle down and have unexpected side effects that are hard to debug. For example, to ensure damage is positive before applying it: If the Custom checkbox is selected, you can pass a custom Exception object that contains more data than a simple message. Most often, this is not required. By default, the thrown exception is of type System.Exception. Toggles Toggle nodes are similar in principle to light-switches: they can be turned on and off to impact either the script or values. Think of them as \"gates\" that can be opened and closed. Toggle Flow The Toggle Flow node gates the flow of control. When on, the flow passes through; when off, the flow does not. There are many inputs and outputs that allow fine grained control over the logic. In the previous example, Toggle is used to show how the same event (a keypress) turns the toggle on and off. Instead you can use On and Off with two different events to get the same results. On the output side, the Is On boolean port indicates the toggle status, that is turned on or off. The control outputs are triggered according to the table below: Port Triggered When On Flow enters the toggle via the unmarked input while it is on. Off Flow enters the toggle via the unmarked input while it is off. Turned On The toggle gets turned on, either via the On or Toggle inputs. Turned Off The toggle gets turned off, either via the Off or Toggle inputs. Toggle Value The Toggle Value node selects between two different input values depending on whether it is on or off. Its ports work exactly like the Toggle Flow node. Another way of implementing the same logic as the previous example: clicking Space toggles the object to move up. This time a value of 1 or 0 is provided as the vertical velocity. Note Turn on relations in the toolbar as a means to visualize the flow between the toggle ports. Once The Once node executes different logic the first time it is traversed from any subsequent times. It can be reset by entering the Reset port. Cache The Cache node saves the result of an expensive operating and reuses it instead of fetching it again each time you need it. For example, using this graph, the formula is calculated twice: By using the Cache node, the result is saved and calculated only once, optimizing performance. Note It is important to note that caching only lasts within the scope of the current flow. The value of the cache is not shared or available from another event."

    "keywords": "Custom C# node attributes reference You can add attributes to a node class and port variable definitions to customize the look of a Custom C# node. Node class attributes You can customize the titles that appear on a node, where it appears in the fuzzy finder, and its icon. Node class attributes must be placed above the node class definition in a node's C# script. Visual Scripting has 5 node class attributes: UnitTitle UnitShortTitle UnitSubtitle UnitCategory TypeIcon Usually, Visual Scripting automatically applies any changes you make to a node's class attributes after you save the C# file. UnitTitle You can specify a [UnitTitle] to display a different title than the node's class name on the node when it appears in a Script Graph, and when you view details about the node in the Graph Inspector: using System; using Unity.VisualScripting; using UnityEngine; [UnitTitle(\"My New Title\")] public class MyNodeAfter : Unit { ... } } The [UnitTitle] attribute overrides the node's class name. UnitShortTitle You can specify a [UnitShortTitle] to display a different title on the node when it appears in a Script Graph: using System; using Unity.VisualScripting; using UnityEngine; [UnitShortTitle(\"Short Title\")] [UnitTitle(\"My New Title\")] public class MyNodeAfter : Unit { ... } } The [UnitShortTitle] only appears on the node in a Script Graph. The [UnitTitle] or node class name still displays in the Graph Inspector. UnitSubtitle You can add a [UnitSubtitle] to add a line of text below the [UnitTitle], [UnitShortTitle], or node class name when a node appears in a Script Graph: using System; using Unity.VisualScripting; using UnityEngine; [UnitSubtitle(\"It's a subtitle!\")] [UnitShortTitle(\"Short Title\")] [UnitTitle(\"My New Title\")] public class MyNodeAfter : Unit { ... } } The [UnitSubtitle] doesn't appear in the Graph Inspector. UnitCategory You can specify a [UnitCategory] to tell Visual Scripting where to place the node in the fuzzy finder: using System; using Unity.VisualScripting; using UnityEngine; [UnitCategory(\"FirstLevel/SecondLevel\")] public class MyNodeAfter : Unit { ... } } Replace FirstLevel with the name of the top-level category in the fuzzy finder where you want Visual Scripting to place the node. Replace SecondLevel with the name of a subcategory. Visual Scripting creates the categories if they don't already exist in the fuzzy finder. Note You must regenerate your Node Library for changes made to a node's [UnitCategory] to take effect. TypeIcon You can use the [TypeIcon] attribute to change the icon that appears on a node when it appears in a Script Graph: using System; using Unity.VisualScripting; using UnityEngine; [TypeIcon(typeof(ToggleValue))] public class MyNodeAfter : Unit { ... } } The icon for the node changes in the Graph Inspector, too. Note You can't point to your own custom icons from this attribute. You must use an icon from the Visual Scripting icons library, which includes all Unity types. Port attributes Custom nodes have one mandatory port attribute and one optional port attribute: DoNotSerialize and PortLabelHidden, respectively. Port attributes must be placed above your variable declarations for each port variable in the node. Visual Scripting automatically applies any changes you make to a node's port attributes after you save the script file. DoNotSerialize [DoNotSerialize] is a mandatory attribute for all ports on custom nodes. Add this attribute to avoid serialization of data that shouldn't be serialized: using System; using Unity.VisualScripting; using UnityEngine; [UnitShortTitle(\"Short Title\")] [UnitTitle(\"My New Title\")] [UnitCategory(\"My Nodes\")] [UnitSubtitle(\"It's a subtitle!\")] [TypeIcon(typeof(Color))] public class MyNodeAfter : Unit { [DoNotSerialize] public ControlInput inputTrigger; [DoNotSerialize] public ControlOutput outputTrigger; [DoNotSerialize] public ValueInput myValueA; [DoNotSerialize] public ValueInput myValueB; [DoNotSerialize] public ValueOutput result; private string resultValue; protected override void Definition() { ... } } PortLabelHidden You can add the [PortLabelHidden] attribute to hide the name label for any port on a node when it appears in a Script Graph: using System; using Unity.VisualScripting; using UnityEngine; [UnitShortTitle(\"Short Title\")] [UnitTitle(\"My New Title\")] [UnitCategory(\"My Nodes\")] [UnitSubtitle(\"It's a subtitle!\")] [TypeIcon(typeof(Color))] public class MyNodeAfter : Unit { [DoNotSerialize] [PortLabelHidden] public ControlInput inputTrigger; [DoNotSerialize] [PortLabelHidden] public ControlOutput outputTrigger; [DoNotSerialize] public ValueInput myValueA; [DoNotSerialize] public ValueInput myValueB; [DoNotSerialize] public ValueOutput result; private string resultValue; protected override void Definition() { ... } } The port's label is still visible in the Graph Inspector. Use the same name in a port's variable definition and the port's key in the Definition method for the node's class, as shown: using System; using Unity.VisualScripting; using UnityEngine; public class MyNode : Unit { ... [DoNotSerialize, PortLabelHidden] public ValueInput myValueA; [DoNotSerialize, PortLabelHidden] public ValueInput myValueB; ... protected override void Definition() { ... myValueA = ValueInput<string>(\"myValueA\", \"Hello \"); myValueB = ValueInput<string>(\"myValueB\", String.Empty); ... } }"

You can create nodes that change the flow of logic in your graph, nodes that manipulate data, or both. You can also create nodes for custom events. To create a Custom C# node, you must: Create a C# script. Add ports. Add logic. Add relations. Create the initial C# script All custom nodes start with a C# file. After you create a C# file, you must regenerate your Node Library through your project settings. This allows Visual Scripting to recognize your Custom C# node and add it to the fuzzy finder for use in your project's graphs. After you regenerate your Node Library the first time, you only need to regenerate your Node Library again if you change the location of a node in the fuzzy finder. You can change the location through the [UnitCategory] attribute. For more information on how to create your initial C# script, see Create a new simple Custom C# node. Add ports Add ports to a node to specify what triggers Visual Scripting to run logic in a node, and decide what data it sends or receives. For more information on ports and nodes, see Nodes. Port types Visual Scripting has four different port types that you can add to a node: ControlInput: Provides a connection to a previous node, which tells Visual Scripting when to start the logic in a node. ControlOutput: Provides a connection to another node, which tells Visual Scripting when to run the logic for the next connected node in a Script Graph. ValueInput: Provides a connection that allows you to pass data into a node for use in its logic. ValueOutput: Provides a connection that allows you to pass data out of a node for use in other nodes. You can add any number of ports to a node. You can also choose what data type the ValueInput or ValueOutput ports send and receive: Generic: The port can receive or output any data type. Corresponds to Unity's Object type. Type Value: The port can only receive or output a specific data type. For example, string, float, or integer. For more information on types in Visual Scripting, see Object types. For more information on how to add ports to your node, see Add ports to your Custom C# node. Add logic Add logic to a node to specify what it does when it runs in a Script Graph. If there isn't any internal logic written for a node, the node can't trigger another node, or modify any of the data it receives from other nodes in a Script Graph. For more information on how to add logic to a node, see Add logic to a Custom C# node. Add relations Relations help define how a node and its Play mode animations appear in Visual Scripting. Without relations, Visual Scripting doesn't know how to animate or display a node in the Graph Editor. Relation types You can add three types of relations to a node to help correctly display its internal flow of logic: Assignment: Assignment relations are usually between a control input port and a data output port. Set an Assignment relation to tell Visual Scripting that a specific port needs to run before the node sends data to a data output port. Succession: Succession relations are usually between a control input port and a control output port. Set a Succession relation to tell Visual Scripting that a control input port exits at a control output port. Requirement: Requirement relations are usually between a control input port and a data port or ports. Set a Requirement relation to let Visual Scripting know that a specific data port or ports must have a value before the node can run any logic. Note If you don't set any Succession relations in a node, and Dim is enabled in the Graph toolbar, Visual Scripting dims your Custom C# node and any of its connected nodes in the Graph Editor during Play mode. For more information on how to add relations to a node, see Add relations to a node. Optional steps and customization After you've added relations, you can choose to add documentation for a node. Visual Scripting displays documentation in the Graph Inspector when a user selects a node in a Script Graph. Add documentation to help other users understand the purpose of each part of a node. You can also choose to customize a node with node attributes. You can add specific node class attributes to customize the entire node, or add port attributes to only customize specific ports. The attribute type determines the location where you must place the attribute in the node's C# file. Node class attributes must be placed above a node class definition, while port attributes must be placed above the variable definition for each port."

All arguments on a Custom Event Trigger node must have values, even if the Custom Event node doesn't give those values to another node. In the following example, Visual Scripting displays an error for both Arg. 0 and Arg. 1, even though Arg. 1 isn't used. Custom Scripting Events You can create a Custom Scripting Event node with a C# script. With C#, you can customize all aspects of your Custom Scripting Event, such as which category or categories to use for your node in the fuzzy finder. For more information, see Create a Custom Scripting Event node. To use and trigger the Event, code a Custom Scripting Event Sender node or another C# script: For more information on how to send or trigger an Event with a node in a Script Graph, see Create a Custom Scripting Event Sender node. For more information on how to send or trigger an Event with code, see Trigger a Custom Scripting Event from a C# script. You can also use a C# script to listen to or receive your Event after you trigger it in a Script Graph. You can use your receiver script to trigger more logic in your application. For more information, see Listen to a Custom Scripting Event from a C# script."

    "keywords": "Custom types Use a C# script file to create your own object types in Unity. These types are called classes. Classes are a blueprint for objects in your code. They decide what kind of data an object holds and what your code can do with that object. A class can hold multiple variables with different data types in a single object. Create a custom class to use it as a type for variables and other objects in a Visual Scripting Script graph. For more information on how to add and use your own custom types in Visual Scripting, see Use a custom type. The code you include in a C# script can also create new nodes to manipulate the data in your class. For example, you might write code to keep track of the characteristics of different player characters in your application. You can create a class, Player, and have different variables in that class for name, character type, favorite color, or player level: using System; using UnityEngine; using Unity.VisualScripting; [Serializable, Inspectable] public class PlayerCharacter { [Inspectable] public string name; [Inspectable] public string type; [Inspectable] public string color; [Inspectable] public int level; } Tip The variables in the example script above use the [Inspectable] attribute so they can display in Unity's Inspector window and the Visual Scripting Graph Inspector. Without the attribute, you can't assign a value to any variables that use the PlayerCharacter class in a Script Graph. For more information about the [Inspectable] attribute, see Use a custom type. These values can be different across different instances of Player objects in your code. Player1 can be Erin, a bard, who loves green and is level 5, and Player2 can be Sam, a mage, who loves black and is level 15. If you tried to represent the same data with basic variables, you must create a lot of nodes, as in the following example. With a custom class, you can create a single node to represent a player character's information, instead of four separate nodes."

For example, attaching a Debug node to a Variable node outputs the value of the variable. Tip Debugs are a useful tool when prototyping. To create a debug message Important Remove or disconnect the debugs from the graphs before producing the final executable. Add a Script Machine component to the GameObject. Select Edit Graph. Do one of the following: Use the starting events that are created with the script machine. Add an event node to the graph. Drag and release from the node port. The fuzzy finder appears. In the finder field, enter “Log”. A list of Debug nodes appears. Select the relevant debug message type you want to use (for example Log(Message), Log Error(Message) or Log Warning(Message)). The select Debug node is placed in the graph and linked to the event. Drag and release from the Debug green (output) port. The fuzzy finder appears. In the list, select the String node. A String node appears on the graph, connected to the Debug node.v Enter the debug message in the string node**.** Tip You can link variables or GameObjects other than a string to the port to see the value in the console. Whenever the graph is run and the Event is fired, the debug node executes and the text in the String appears in the console.

    "title": "Predictive and Live Debugging | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Predictive and Live Debugging Note For versions 2019/2020 LTS, download the Visual Scripting package from the Unity Asset Store. Visual scripting can predict and indicate nodes in the script that can cause an error before entering play mode. It also analyzes your graphs to anticipate missing components or null references. If an error occurs at runtime, visual scripting pin-points the source of the error by highlighting it in the graph. Predictive Debugging When a node is not properly configured or may cause an error, it is colored yellow. When a node is certain to cause an error, it is colored orange. In both cases you should examine the node and make the required changes until it turns back to its normal color. Example: The Log node is colored orange because it's missing the Message that it should output to the console. If you connect the result of A + B to Message, the Log node goes back to normal. However, the Add node turns orange, because it's missing its first operand, A. If values are provided for both operands, all colors return to normal. The B input port does not need to be connected as it has a default inline value. Null References Null reference exceptions are very common. They happen when a parameter expects a value, but it receives \"nothing\", or in scripting lingo, \"null\". Visual scripting attempts to predict null references if the Predict Potential Null References option is checked in Unity > Preferences > Visual Scripting > Flow Graph. Example: Even though the Destroy node has an inline value, as it is set to \"None\" (null), it is colored orange. There are some rarer nodes that allow for null parameters. Unfortunately, because there is no way to know that from codebase analysis, visual scripting colors them orange as a false positive. If this is a recurring issue, turn off Predict Potential Null References. Missing Components When nodes are used that require components and pass a game object or a component that does not have the specified component, the node is colored yellow as a warning. For example, even though there are default values for each value input of the Add Force node, visual scripting detects that the owner game object does not have a rigidbody and provides a warning. Visual scripting does not color the node orange because it is possible to add components to game objects at runtime, so the node is not guaranteed to cause a crash if you add the required component before calling it. If this use case happens often in the project, you can disable Predict Potential Missing Components debugging from Unity > Preferences > Visual Scripting > Flow Graphs. Live Debugging When in play mode, the currently active nodes are highlighted in blue. If an error occurs, the node that caused it is highlighted in red. Example: The following is an example of a faulty graph. The result logs \"my 3rd third favorite fruit\" to the console when you press space. Here's what happens when play is selected and the object is clicked. All nodes are highlighted in blue as soon as you click because they were activated. However, there was an error in the console. Visual scripting highlights the faulty node in red. A common mistake is to assume array indices start at 1, whereas they actually start at 0. In scripting, indices are always zero-based; the first item is at index 0, the second at index 1, the third at index 2, etc. To get third item, write 2 in the field."

Cause of the build errors Unity Visual Scripting (UVS) doesn't support preprocessor directives, so the use of Unity Editor script functions within graphs isn't possible. However, these functions can appear as node options within UVS because UVS uses C# reflection to generate nodes for your project based on your included assemblies. If you add one of these Unity Editor script nodes to a graph that's used in a build of your project, Unity generates an error when it attempts to build the project. An error message of the following format is displayed in the Unity Console: /<ProjectPath>/<CSharpFile>.cs: error CS0103: The name '<MissingApiName>' does not exist in the current context. The following code sample is an example of preprocessor directives for Unity Editor scripts : #if UNITY_EDITOR public static List<Type> GetAllVolumeComponents() { // TypeCache is only accessible in UnityEditor. // If you instantiate a GetAllVolumeComponents node in a graph // it prevents the project from being built. return TypeCache.GetTypesDerivedFrom<VolumeComponent>().ToList(); } #endif Find flagged packages Packages that contain editor scripts are flagged with a warning icon in the Node Library section of the Visual Scripting tab in the Project Settings window. To find the affected packages, do the following: Go to Edit > Project Settings. In the Project Settings window, select the Visual Scripting tab. On the Visual Scripting tab expand the Node Library section. A yellow warning flag is displayed next to any affected packages as shown in the following screenshot. Resolution To resolve this issue, go through your graphs and replace nodes that correspond to the API mentioned in the error message until you find the error no longer occurs."

    "keywords": "Events node Note For versions 2019/2020 LTS, download the Visual Scripting package from the Unity Asset Store. Scripting nodes listen for events. They are the starting point for all scripts and appear as special green nodes in graphs. There are many kinds of events, grouped in sub-categories under the root Events category (fuzzy finder > Events). Two simple common events are Start and Update, both located under Lifecycle. Start is called once when the graph or event handler is first created. Update is called at every frame while the graph or event handler is active. New script machines start with both these events by default. Inputs & Outputs All events have a single Trigger control output that starts the script when they are triggered. Value inputs are options that influence when the event is triggered. For example, some events have a Target setting that determines which object is listening to the event. Most often, you'll leave this setting at its default value of Self. The value outputs on events are arguments that are passed from the event, giving you more information about what actually happened. For example, on the On Trigger Enter event, the other collider that is involved in the collision is an output. Custom Events There is a special type of event, the Custom Event that triggers custom events across graphs, along with their custom arguments. For example, to create a custom event called On Damage that gets called so the character loses health, the event should have one integer argument that indicates the amount of damage to inflict. Listen to the event by creating a Custom Event node (under Events). Set the name to On Damage. The set the argument count, below the name, to 1. Note Indices are zero-based, so the first argument is labeled Arg. 0. To trigger the event from elsewhere, use the Trigger Custom Event node, located right under the Custom Event node in the fuzzy finder. Enter the name of the event exactly as it is sensitive to case and whitespace. For example, to create a script machine on a boulder that could hit the player, use the force of the impact as the damage. The collider that hit with the boulder is the target of our trigger; the On Damage event is triggered on all machines attached to that collider. Use the damage value to subtract health from the receiver object. Custom events do not require a receiver and do not cause an error if there isn't a listener to handle them. Animation Events Use animation events to trigger Bolt graphs when you reach a certain point in your animation. Select an object with a machine and an animator. Then, from the animation window, add an animation event. With the event selected, choose TriggerAnimationEvent as the function from the inspector. Use any parameter from the inspector. In your script graph, add an Animation Event node (under Events >Animation). There are two types of events: a global animation event, and a named animation event. The difference is that the first type listens to all animation events on the object and return the string parameter. The second type's trigger is the string parameter that is equal to the specified name input. Unity Events Use Unity Events to trigger events that have been setup from the inspector. These are commonly found in GUI components like buttons, but they can also be created in your custom scripts. Configure them by selecting an object with a machine and select the Trigger Unity Event method. In the string field, type the event name to listen to in the graph and in the graph, add a UnityEvent node with a matching name. Additional arguments are not supported on Unity events. Events API Visual scripting provides a simple API to trigger custom events from C# script. Add the following usings to your C# script to access the API. using Unity.VisualScripting Triggering API A single method call is needed to trigger a custom event. Pass as many arguments as required. CustomEvent.Trigger(targetGameObject, argument1, argument2, ...) For example, this custom event node: Can be triggered with this line of code. CustomEvent.Trigger(enemy, \"Damage\", 30);"

    "title": "Formula node | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Formula node Note For versions 2019/2020 LTS, download the Visual Scripting package from the Unity Asset Store. Formula is a powerful node that evaluates logical and mathematical expressions directly via a textual Formula and a list of Arguments. Important Due to the binary tree traversal overhead (despite caching attempts), performance in using the formula node is significantly slower than using the operator nodes individually. It is preferable to avoid using this node at every frame. Although a formula can return either a boolean for logic, or a number for math, formulas can return any type of value. The first text field in the header is the formula itself. The second text field is the number of arguments. It's set to 2 by default, giving us A and B as inputs. Formulas can have up to 10 arguments, which are always ordered alphabetically. If more are required, they are called B, C, D, E, and so forth. For example, this formula returns a boolean indicating: whether, at a minimum, 10 seconds have elapsed since the start of the game and the current object's name is Player. Arguments Variable Names Variable names can be directly used in the formula. For example, a graph variable named health can return a boolean just by typing the formula health > 50. The argument names are evaluated in the following order of priority: Alphabetical argument names (a - z) Graph variable names Object variable names Scene variable names Application variable names Saved variable names Properties and Methods Retrieve the value of a property on an argument or variable by using the [arg.prop] notation. For example, if position is a Vector 3 object variable, check if it is equal to zero with: [position.x] = 0. Get the return value of parameterless methods with the [arg.Method()] notation. Note: Accessing properties and methods is not guaranteed to be compatible with AOT platforms, because the AOT pre-build cannot generate stubs for members that are only accessed by name. Literals Use the following literals for assigning fixed values. Literal Description Example Number An integer or float. 3.5 String A piece of text between apostrophes. \"Hello World!\" Boolean A boolean value. true, false Null The null constant. a != null Delta Time The Unity frame delta time. 30 * dt Invert Delta Time The inverse of the delta time. 30 / second Operators Every common logical and mathematical operator can be used in formulas, as well as the ones defined through custom operator overloading in script. Operator Operation Rank Result Example not, ! Logical Negation Unary The opposite of the operand. not true - Numerical Negation Unary The negative of the operand. -5 and, && Logical And Binary True if both operands are true. (a < 5) and (b > 3) or, || Logical Or Binary True if either operand is true (a < 5) or (b > 3) =, == Equality Binary True if the two operands are equal. a = b !=, <> Inequality Binary True if the two operands are not equal. a != b <, <=, >, >= Numeric Comparison Binary The result of a numeric comparison a >= 10 + Addition Binary The sum of the two operands. a + 5 - Subtraction Binary The difference between the two operands. b - 3 * Multiplication Binary The product of the two operands. 12 * a / Division Binary The quotient of the two operands. b / 2 % Modulo Binary The remainder of the division of the two operands. a % 2 ?: If Ternary The left operand if the condition is true, otherwise the right operand. (health > 0) ? \"Alive\" : \"Dead\" All common bitwise operators like ~ and >> are also supported. Functions You can also use any function from the following table. Name Result Example abs The absolute value of a specified number. abs(-1) acos The angle whose cosine is the specified number. acos(1) asin The angle whose sine is the specified number. asin(0) atan The angle whose tangent is the specified number. atan(0) ceiling The smallest integer greater than or equal to the specified number. ceiling(1.5) cos The cosine of the specified angle. cos(0) exp e raised to the specified power. exp(0) floor The largest integer less than or equal to the specified number. floor(1.5) log The logarithm of a specified number. log(1, 10) log10 The base 10 logarithm of a specified number. log10(1) max The larger of two specified numbers. max(1, 2) min The smaller of two numbers. min(1, 2) pow A specified number raised to the specified power. pow(3, 2) round Rounds a value to the nearest integer or specified number of decimal places. round(3.222, 2) sign 1 if the number is positive, -1 is if it negative. sign(-10) sin The sine of the specified angle. sin(0) sqrt The square root of a specified number. sqrt(4) tan The tangent of the specified angle. tan(0) truncate The integral part of a number. truncate(1.7) v2 Creates a 2D vector. v2(0, 0) v3 Creates a 3D vector. v3(0, 0, 0) v4 Creates a 4D vector. v4(0, 0, 0, 0)"

    "keywords": "Script Machines and State Machines A Script Machine is a GameObject component that lets you use a Script Graph in an application. You can't use a Script Graph unless it's attached to a Script Machine. For more information on components, see Introduction to components in the Unity User Manual. Script Machines can either link to a graph asset, or they can contain an embedded Script Graph asset. A State Machine is the same as a Script Machine, except it contains a State Graph. For more information on the difference between a Script Graph and a State Graph, see Graphs. Add a Script Machine or State Machine component to a GameObject and Visual Scripting automatically adds a Variables component. The Variables component holds any Object variables that you define in a Script Graph or State Graph attached to the GameObject. For more information on variables, see Variables. For more information on how to add a Script Machine or State Machine to a GameObject and attach a graph file, see Attach a graph file to a Script Machine or State Machine Source types Script Machines and State Machines have two options for their Source: a graph file (Graph), or an embedded asset (Embed). Set the Source for a Script Machine or State Machine at any time. If you switch the Source from Graph to Embed, the graph file still exists as a separate file from the State Machine or Script Machine inside of your project. Caution If you switch your Source from Embed to Graph, you will lose the embedded graph asset. You can copy the nodes from an embedded graph to a graph asset to avoid data loss. Other features of Visual Scripting, such as transitions, Super States, and Subgraphs, also have these source type options. The Graph source type Use the Graph source type to make your graphs faster to load and easier to maintain. Any changes made to a graph file apply to every Script Machine or State Machine that links to that graph file, even if those GameObjects don't use the same Prefab. To use the same graph across multiple GameObjects, use a Graph source type. You might encounter some situations where an embedded graph works best. The Embed source type An Embed graph exists only in the scene where it's created, if it isn't attached to a Prefab. This can cause problems with source control systems. If you delete a GameObject with an Embed graph asset, you will lose your graph. Changes made to an embedded graph aren't saved while the Editor is in Play mode. Use the Embed source type if: You need references to GameObjects from the current scene in the graph and the graph isn't on a Prefab. The graph is on a Prefab that you plan to instantiate in the application during runtime. You only need to use the logic in the graph once in the application. You can't reuse an embedded graph across multiple GameObjects unless the graph is on a Prefab. An embed graph only exists on the Script Machine or State Machine where you created it. This means you can share the graph across instances of a Prefab, but not on more than one GameObject. For more information about Prefabs, see Prefabs in the User Manual."

    "title": "Graphs | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Graphs A graph is a Visual Scripting asset that contains a visual representation of logic in an application. Visual Scripting has two different types of graphs: Script Graphs and State Graphs. You can use either graph type in specific situations to define and change how GameObjects in an application behave. Script Graphs and State Graphs must be attached to a Script Machine or State Machine to be used in a project. For more information on Script Machines and State Machines, see Script Machines and State Machines. Script Graphs Script Graphs control and connect specific actions and values. The actions in a Script Graph happen in a specific order. Actions can happen every frame, or when a specific event occurs. Visual Scripting represents the actions in a Script Graph through nodes. Connect nodes together with edges to tell your application what to do, and in what order. Script Graphs can access a large collection of nodes, which correspond to different features and functionality in the Unity Editor. Access these nodes through the fuzzy finder. Script Graphs define the specifics of what a GameObject does while your application runs. State Graphs A State Graph has states and gives the logic for when your application moves between states, through connections called transitions. Use State Graphs to design AI behavior or define scene and level structures. A state is any set of behaviors that you want a GameObject to perform, represented as a Script Graph. Visual Scripting represents states in State Graphs through State nodes. A State node can link to a Script Graph with logic for your application to follow, or give another State Graph with additional transitions and State nodes. States and transitions in a State Graph tell your application when to change its behavior, based on an event or after it fulfills a condition. For example, you might have an enemy character with Patrol and Chase states. The enemy character's actions can change from the actions in the Script Graph for the Patrol state to the actions for the Chase state after it detects the player character. The detection event for the enemy character triggers the transition between the two states. State Graphs don't use the fuzzy finder. They use a specific set of State nodes, which are in the Visual Scripting context menu: Script States contain a Script Graph. When an application triggers a Script State, Visual Scripting runs the logic in a Script State's attached Script Graph. Script States use On Enter State Event, On Update Event, and On Exit State Event nodes to control logic based on the current state. Super States contain another, nested State Graph. A Super State can help you better organize a State Graph, and reuse states and transitions across multiple graphs. Any States serve as a placeholder for any other state in a State Graph. You can use an Any State node and create a single transition to a new state, rather than create multiple transitions from other states. Transitions connect Script States, Any States, and Super States. Transitions contain Script Graphs that tell your application when to switch from one state to the next. For more information, see Transitions. You can set any Script State node or Super State node as a Start State. Any state marked as a Start State is automatically active when Visual Scripting runs a State Graph. You can also have multiple Start States in a single graph. The Super State, Start, and Script State nodes in the following example are all Start States."

To disable these animations on either the value connections, the control connections, or both, deselect the Animate Control Connections or the Animate Value Connections from the editor preferences window (Edit > Preferences > Visual Scripting > Script Graphs). Saving changes through persistence Visual Scripting graphs automatically save the changes made during play mode. Propagation across graphs Changes made to a graph are instantly shared across all instances of that graph."

Visual Scripting uses your chosen Input Action and its configuration in your Input Actions asset to determine the Vector 2 value returned by this port. See the Example graph usage section for an example. For more information about how to configure Input Action settings and use an Input Action asset, see Input Action Assets in the Input System package documentation. Example graph usage In the following example, an On Input System Event Vector 2 node uses the bindings assigned to the Move Input Action. When a user presses a button from the Move binding, Visual Scripting takes the Vector 2 value it receives from the Input System and sends it as an input to the Transform Set Position node's Value input port. The Vector 2 value changes the position of the GameObject associated with the Target transform. For this example, Move uses the W, A, S, and D keys. The GameObject moves up in the scene when the user presses W, moves down when the user presses S, and moves left or right when the user presses A or D.

    "keywords": "Nodes Nodes are the most basic part of scripts in Visual Scripting. A node can listen for events, get the value of a variable, modify a component on a GameObject, and more. Nodes appear as blocks in the Graph Editor. You can arrange and connect these blocks with edges to create logic for an application. Add nodes with the fuzzy finder. Click and drag a node to move it in the Graph Editor. Node anatomy Visual Scripting highlights nodes in your current selection. All nodes have a header, which displays the node's name. Some node headers might contain additional information or controls. Select a node in your graph, the Visual Scripting Graph Inspector displays the following information: The node's name and type icon. A brief description of what the node does, if available. The current warning messages or errors for the node. The additional settings for the node, if available. The required type for each input port and a brief description, if available. The type for each output port and a brief description, if available. Connections and ports Connect a port from one node to a compatible port on another node to create an edge. Edges form the logic flow in a Visual Scripting graph. Click any port to create a new edge. Edges are color-coded: edges that control the logic flow in your graph are white. Data edges are colored based on their type. For more information about types, see Object types. When you create a new edge, Visual Scripting highlights ports on any other nodes in a graph where you can make a valid connection. If you enable Dim Incompatible Nodes, Visual Scripting also dims any nodes or ports without a valid connection. Ports on the left side of a node are Input Ports. Ports on the right side of a node are Output Ports. An input port or output port can be a Control Port or a Data Port: Control Ports control the logical flow in a graph. They tell Visual Scripting what order to execute the nodes in a graph, from left to right. The icon for a control port is always an arrow. These arrows display the direction of the flow of logic in a graph. Data Ports send and receive data, such as number values or GameObjects, between nodes. They have colors that correspond to the specific type they expect to receive as inputs, or send as outputs. Their icons change based on their type. You can make multiple connections to or from the same port, with some restrictions: You can connect a single Data Output port to multiple Data Input ports. You can't connect multiple Data Output ports to a single Data Input port. Visual Scripting can't choose which value to use. You can connect multiple Control Output ports to a single Control Input port. You can't connect a single Control Output port to multiple Control Input ports. Visual Scripting can't choose which node to run first. For more information on how to connect nodes, see Connect nodes in a Script Graph. More complex nodes can have more complex or specialized ports, outside of the ports described here. Node controls and inline values A node might have additional controls that display on its header or in the Graph Inspector. Controls can change the available ports or behavior of a node. Some ports might also use inline values. Element Example Description Control A control appears as a dropdown option on the header of a node. For example, a Container Type control might tell a node to expect to receive a GameObject instead of a Script Machine. Inline Value An inline value appears as an object picker field next to a port. You can use an inline value instead of a node connection to specify a value for a node. Not all Visual Scripting types support inline values. ## Node overloads Variations of a Visual Scripting node are called overloads. Overloads change the input and output data that a node can accept, and can change the number of input or output data ports on a node. For example, the Add node has four overloads, as shown in the following image of the fuzzy finder after a search for Add. You can distinguish each overload through its subcategory in the fuzzy finder. The Add node is a part of the Math category, but each overload is a part of a different subcategory: Generic, Scalar, Vector 2, Vector 3, or Vector 4. The specific node overload changes what input and output data the Add node can accept. While a Generic Add node can input and output any object type in Visual Scripting, a Vector 3 Add node can only take 3D vectors as an input, and can only output a single 3D vector: The default type and number of ports on the Add node stays consistent across its overloads. For the Rotate node, the type and number of ports varies. Based on the Rotate node you select, you might be able to specify the angle of rotation as a vector, as separate float values, or as an angle relative to each axis. You can also choose whether the node rotates the GameObject relative to itself, or relative to the center of the scene's world space."

Leaving a Unity object reference field empty (\"None\") automatically means null. Null Check The null check is a shortcut for a branch on an equality comparison with null. It can be useful to direct the flow in different directions depending on whether a value is null. For example, it can be used to handle a situation differently whether a transform has a parent in the hierarchy or not. Null Coalesce The null coalesce node provides a fallback value in case the original input is null. For example, the null coalesce node defines a default fallback audio clip in case the one on the audio source is missing."

NOTE For more information on script editors in Unity, see Integrated development environment (IDE) support in the Unity User Manual. In your external editor, do the following: Add the [RenamedFrom] attribute above the definition of the part of the script you want to rename. Add the element's old name as a string to the [RenamedFrom] attribute, as its parameter. For example: using UnityEngine; using Unity.VisualScripting; [RenamedFrom(\"Character\")] public class Player : MonoBehaviour { [RenamedFrom(\"InflictDamage\")] public void TakeDamage(int damage) { //... } } [!include[save-script](./snippets/vs-save-script.md)] [!include[return-unity](./snippets/vs-return-unity.md)] [!include[regen-node-library](./snippets/vs-regen-node-library.md)] Note If you change the namespace or namespaces used in your script, you must include the old namespace or namespaces to use the [RenamedFrom] attribute. Next steps Unity recommends that you leave the attribute in the script file, even after a successful recompile.

Visual scripting uses this information in the background for Predictive Debugging. For example, if you tried to get the value of A + B without providing a value for A, the node would show up as orange to indicate that it fails in play mode. When that happens, you can use the warnings shown in the Graph Inspector to know what is missing. Relations can also help understand the ports that are required and which ports are optional. For example, in the Get Child node (under fuzzy finder Codebase > Unity Engine > Transform), there is no need to connect the control ports if the goal is to get the transform value output.

    "keywords": "Time nodes Note For versions 2019/2020 LTS, download the Visual Scripting package from the Unity Asset Store. Time nodes include timer, cooldown and wait nodes. Wait Wait nodes delay the execution of the rest of the script. The delay can be a set amount of seconds or a condition that must be fulfilled before moving on. Asynchronicity (delayed execution) in Unity is handled by coroutines (not multithreading). You need to inform visual scripting to run the script as a coroutine in order to support wait nodes. To do this enable the Coroutine checkbox on the initial event that starts the script. Do this in the graph inspector. A small dual-arrow icon appears on the event, indicating that it runs as a coroutine. If the coroutine checkbox is not enabled, an error at runtime indicates a port 'can only be triggered in a coroutine' when reaching a wait node. All wait nodes are also used inside loops and sequences. Wait For Seconds The Wait For Seconds node is the simplest and most common wait node. It delays the execution by a certain number of seconds. Wait Until The Wait Until node stops execution until a given condition is met. For example, you could wait until an object is close enough. Wait While The Wait While node is the opposite of the Wait Until node: it stops execution as long as a given condition is met. For example, you can wait while an object is out of range. Wait For Frame As the name implies, Wait For End Of Frame and Wait For Next Frame nodes delays execution until a specific point in Unity's update loop is met. For more information, see: Execution Order of Events. Wait For Script The Wait For Script node delays execution until all input scripts have been entered at least once. It's a useful way of grouping conditions that occur over multiple events or frames. In other languages, this concept is sometimes called \"promises\". Cooldown The Cooldown node implements a time restriction when the input script can only be triggered a limited number of times. When the cooldown is available, the input script gets transferred to the Ready port. When it is not, it gets transferred to the Not Ready port. The Duration port determines how long it takes for the cooldown to become available again. Checking Unscaled makes it ignore the time scale. The Tick port gets called at every frame while a cooldown is active. It is a good place to update any GUI code that show an indicator of the remaining duration until the action can be called again. In order to get that value, you have two options: Remaining, which returns the number of seconds until ready, and Remaining %, which returns a value between 0 and 1, respectively from ready to not ready. As soon as the cooldown is ready, the Completed port is triggered. There is no need to constantly pass input script for this port to get triggered. Finally, you can force the cooldown to become ready and reset its internal timer by triggering the Reset port. For example, a simple cooldown firing mechanic with a masked sprite and text that indicates how much time is remaining until it can fire again. Timer The Timer node implements and monitors a time pausable progression. The Duration port determines how long it takes for the cooldown to become available again. Checking Unscaled makes it ignore the time scale. A timer is started by triggering the Start input, which in turn triggers the Started output. It can be paused and resumed with the Pause and Resume inputs, or it can alternate between these states with the Toggle input. The Tick port gets called at every frame while a timer is active. In order to get the time measurements, you have two options: Elapsed, which returns the time since the timer was started, or Remaining, which returns the time until the timer completes. You can get each of these measurements in absolute number of seconds, or in %, which returns a value between 0 and 1. This is useful for lerping. As soon as the timer finishes, the Completed port is triggered. For example, a simple autodestroy mechanic on a sprite that is progressively colored red before being destroyed."

    "title": "Transitions | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Transitions A transition is a connection between State nodes in a State Graph. A transition has a Script Graph that tells Visual Scripting when to switch states in a State Graph. A special transition type, called a self transition, can make a state transition to itself. You can embed the Script Graph for a transition in the Transition node itself, or link to an external graph asset file. Use Event nodes and a Trigger Transition node in the Script Graph you attach to a transition. These nodes specify which event or events must occur to trigger a change of state in your parent State Graph. For example, the following transition Script Graph switches states after a GameObject with the Player tag enters a trigger Collider. Any transition nodes with a transition Script Graph display the name of the event in the graph that triggers the state change. For example, the following parent State Graph displays the graph from the previous example as an On Trigger Enter Transition node. If you've assigned a name to a transition Script Graph, the assigned name appears on the Transition node. Tip To reduce the space taken up by transition nodes in a State Graph, you can hide their name labels. For more information, see Configure your preferences. You can create any number of transitions between states in a State Graph. For more information on how to create transitions, see Create a transition between states."

    "title": "Object types | Confectionary-Docs",
    "keywords": "Object types All scripting in Unity is based on the C# programming language. C# is a \"strongly typed\" language. This means that all data and objects in Visual Scripting have a specific type. For example, a variable can be a number with an integer type, or the object provided by a node's output port can be a GameObject. Types help the computer run Visual Scripting code. Visual Scripting's behavior might not depend on the object type you give a node as an input, but sometimes, an object's type is important. For example, to add a new variable in the Blackboard, you must specify the variable's type to assign it a value. When you make a new edge in the Graph Editor, some nodes might have ports that only allow a connection if the data input is the correct type. Choose the type for an object with the Type menu. For example, you can choose the type for a Data Input port on a Script Graph with the Type menu from the Graph Inspector. Enter a search term in the Type menu to find a specific object type. You can also navigate through the namespaces listed in the Type menu to find a type. Visual Scripting identifies namespaces in the Type menu with an arrow (>). Select any namespace to view the other namespaces or available types within that namespace. Common object types Unity has hundreds of types. You can also add your own custom types. For more information on custom types, see Custom types. The following table includes some commonly used types in Visual Scripting. Type Description Float A float is a numeric value, with or without decimal places. For example, 0.25 or 13.1. Integer An integer is a numeric value without decimal places. For example, 3 or 200. Boolean A Boolean is a true or false value. Use a Boolean to create logic in a Script Graph and for toggles. For example, a Script Graph can trigger an event only if a condition is true. String A string is a sequence of characters or piece of text. For example, string, string123, and s. Char A char is a single alphanumeric character from a string. For example, s or 1. Enum An enum is a finite enumeration of options. Enums are usually represented as dropdowns. For example, a Force Mode enum can have a value of either Force, Impulse, Acceleration, or Velocity Change. Vector A vector represents a set of float coordinates. Unity uses vectors for positions or directions. Vector 2 A Vector 2 has X and Y values. You can use a Vector 2 for coordinates in 2D spaces. Vector 3 A Vector 3 has X, Y, and Z values. You can use a Vector 3 for coordinates in 3D spaces. Vector 4 A Vector 4 has X, Y, Z, and W values. You can use a Vector 4 for coordinates in 4D spaces, such as parameters for shaders. GameObject A GameObject is the basic entity used in Unity scenes. All GameObjects have a name, a transform for their position and rotation in the scene, and a list of components. List A list is an ordered collection of elements. The elements in a list can each have their own type or all have the same type. Visual Scripting indexes items in a list with the first position at 0. This means that the first element of a list is at the 0 index of the list. The second item is at the 1 index, the third is at the 2 index, and so on. Dictionary A dictionary is a collection of elements. Each element has a unique key and a value. Use a key to access and assign the values for an element in a dictionary. For example, you can use a dictionary to organize the names and ages of a group of people. The person's name is the key to the value of their age. A single element in the dictionary can be John and 33. Object An Object is a special type in Unity. If a data input port on a node has its type set to Object, the node doesn't need a specific type as an input. Supported type conversions Visual Scripting can automatically convert some data types passed between nodes. For example, the following graph gets the Transform from a child GameObject of the current GameObject, and triggers an Animator Controller to play an animation. Visual Scripting converts the Transform component sent by the Transform Get Child node to the Animator Controller component on the same GameObject. Visual Scripting can automatically perform the following type conversions: Number to Number (for example, you can convert an integer to a float, such as 5 to 5.0, or 5.0 to 5) Base class to child class Child class to base class Custom operators (for example, you can convert a Vector 2 to a Vector 3) GameObject to a component (for example, a GameObject to its Rigidbody component) Component to GameObject (for example, a Rigidbody component to its GameObject) Component to component on the same GameObject (for example, a Rigidbody component to a Transform component) Enum to array Enum to list"

You can't assign a value to a variable with a custom type from Unity's Inspector window, or initialize it from inside the Unity Editor if this additional code isn't available. You must assign a default value for a custom type through the Inspector window to use that type for a variable in Visual Scripting. You have two options to enable variable assignment and initialization: If you have access to the source code, you can add the [Inspectable] attribute to the classes and fields that you want to display and modify in the Editor.

You can't view your classes and fields in the Inspector window without the [Inspectable] attribute. Unity provides a basic UI for your types in the Inspector window, which might not give the aesthetic results you want. If you or your users want to configure a property for a custom type with a slider, for example, don't use the [Inspectable] attribute method.

    "keywords": "Variables node Note For versions 2019/2020 LTS, download the Visual Scripting package from the Unity Asset Store. There are six kinds of variable nodes. Each of these variable nodes has three object nodes: Get, to retrieve the value of the variable Set, to assign a new value to the variable Is Defined, to check whether the variable is defined They are located under the Variables category in the fuzzy finder. Variable nodes are teal colored. Dynamic Typing For get / set nodes, variables are not statically typed, meaning their type can change at runtime. Their type displays as an object when defined from the blackboard window. Get Variable The get variable node requires the name of the variable as an input and returns the Value as an output. Set Variable The set variable nodes require the name of the variable and the new value assigned to it as inputs. For convenience in layouting, it returns this same value as an output. Connect the control input port to indicate when the variable should be assigned and, optionally, the control output port to indicate what to do after. Using a set node with a variable name that doesn't yet exist creates the variable. Has Variable The Has Variable nodes require the name of the variable as an input and returns an Is Defined boolean as an output. They're useful to check if a variable has been created, and often, provide a fallback value if it hasn't. Do the same thing more easily by checking the Fallback box in the graph inspector for a Get Variable node. This adds a Fallback input to the node that is returned if the variable hasn't been defined: Dynamic Variables As the name of the variable is a standard value input port, connect it to any other port that returns a string. Refer to \"dynamic variables\", that is, variables whose reference might change during play mode. Object Variables Object variable nodes require an additional input for the Source. That port indicates which game object the variable you're referring to is defined. When left to its default value, they look on the current object (self). For example, the Get Variable node gets the value of the health variable on the player2 object. Dropdowns The kind and the name dropdowns can quickly configure the variable nodes. The name suggestions are contextual and are based on the existing variables of this kind and on the other variable nodes in the current graph. Drag and Drop Drag and drop items from the blackboard window directly into the graph to create matching nodes. By default, a Get node is created. If the Alt key is held, a Set node is created. If the Shiftkey is held, an Is Defined node is created. Variables API Visual scripting provides an easy API to handle variables, to get or set their value and verify if they are defined.

    "keywords": "Variables Variables act as a container for a piece of information that might change as an application runs. To define a variable, you need to provide: A name for the variable, such as MyVariable. The type of data the variable holds, such as int or string . A value for the variable, such as 1 or cat. In Visual Scripting, you can give a node the name of a variable, instead of a fixed value or text. Your Script Graph uses the variable's name to access its value. For example, you can use a variable called Count, with an int type and a value of 1. You can use an Add node in Visual Scripting to add 1 to the value of Count, and save the new value in Count to use again in another part of your Script Graph, or a different Script Graph. Variables also have scopes. A variable's scope determines what parts of your Script Graph can access which variables to read or modify their values. The scope can also decide whether another Script Graph can access a variable. You can create and manage variables in a graph from the Blackboard. For more information on the Blackboard, see The Blackboard. For more information on how to use variables, see Create and add a variable to a Script Graph. Variable scopes Each variable scope has its own tab on the Blackboard, except Flow variables. Visual Scripting has six variable scopes. Variable Scope Property Flow Variables Flow variables are like local variables in a scripting language: they have the smallest scope. You can't use a Flow variable if: The Flow variable doesn’t have a direct or indirect connection to the nodes where you want to use its value. The node where the variable is defined must be a part of the logical flow where you want to use its value. The Flow variable hasn’t been set before Visual Scripting tries to run any logic that needs its value. The node where the variable is defined must come before any other logic in your graph. You can't create a Flow variable from the Blackboard - you can create one with a Set Variable node and set the Scope to Flow. Graph Variables Graph variables belong to a specific Script Graph. You can't access or modify Graph variables outside the specific Script Graph where they're defined. You also can't create a new Graph variable unless you have a Script Graph open in the Graph window. Object Variables Object variables belong to a specific GameObject. You can edit an Object variable from the Unity Editor's Inspector for the GameObject, and the Object variable is accessible in all graphs attached to the GameObject. You can't create a new Object variable unless you've opened your Script Graph from a Script Machine component on a GameObject. Scene Variables Scene variables belong to the current scene. Visual Scripting creates a new GameObject in your scene to hold references to your Scene variables. You can access your Scene variables from any Script Graph attached to a different GameObject in a single scene, but can't access a Scene variable in another scene in your project. App or Application Variables Application variables belong to your entire application. You can access an Application variable across multiple scenes while your application runs, and the Application variable would hold your changes. Any values held in an Application variable reset to their default values after your application quits. Saved Variables Saved variables are like Application variables, but they persist even after your application quits. You can use a Saved variable as a simple but powerful save system. Unity stores Saved variables in its PlayerPrefs, and they don't refer to Unity objects, like GameObjects and components. For more information on PlayerPrefs, see PlayerPrefs in the Unity User Manual Scripting Reference. Note You can still access the Blackboard and create new variables with a State Graph open in the Graph window, but you can't add a variable node and use it inside a State Graph. For Saved variables, there are two additional tabs on the Blackboard: Initial and Saved: Values defined in the Initial tab apply to all new instances of your application as default values. Values defined in the Saved tab are the last modified values for those variables, based on when you last ran your application. You can edit them manually, or delete the values to reset them to the values defined in the Initial tab."
