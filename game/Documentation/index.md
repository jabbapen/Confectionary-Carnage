# Confectionary Carnage Docs
This website documents the C# internals of Confectionary Carnage's game
frontend. If you're unfamiliar with Unity, we've briefly summarized important
concepts we've used [here](./unity_concepts.md).
Unity's full documentation is located [here](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> DocFX Unity Integration has [open bugs](https://github.com/NormandErwan/DocFxForUnity/issues/9#issuecomment-1807217793), but we've done the best we can.
