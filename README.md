# Confectionary Carnage:

Confectionary Carnage is a game we designed to help students relieve stress through light-hearted entertainment. In this 2D top-down shooter, players navigate through endlessly new and engaging levels, dodging and shooting in a world filled with candy-themed enemies and environments. The game allows players to create and submit their own levels, as well as play through levels crafted by others, adding endless variety and replayability. With a focus on fun and stress relief, players can compete for high scores, engage in creative level design, and enjoy a light-hearted escape from their day-to-days.
